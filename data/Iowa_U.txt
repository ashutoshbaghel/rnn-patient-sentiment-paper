29	-1	commentsAfter waiting over an hour past our scheduled appointment time, he had zero patience, compassion, or bedside manner of any kind- all of which are VERY important in pediatrics.  I am unable to comment on his competency or knowledge as a surgeon because we left during the exam as it was so traumatic for our child.  However since I'm required to assign a number I selected 3 (neutral) and deducted one because regardless of any surgical expertise he may have, it was very clear he was lacking in knowledge about normal child behavior which I consider fairly important in a PEDIATRIC surgeon. 	1	1	1	2	Insurance:Unknown
