7	1	commentsDr. Ingraham saw me in the hospital after a ruptured brain aneurysm.  He was in TN at the time.  He was very nice and always brought a smile on my face.  He is since practicing in South Dakota.  I wish he were still here because if I ever need brain surgery I would trust him to do it.  I have recovered fully from my ruptured brain aneurysm.  Dr. Ingraham checked on me several times in the hospital.  He did not perform surgery on me because coiling was chosen as being the best option in my case.  It was very nice of him to follow up with me in the hospital.  Rapid City, South Dakota residents you have an amazing neurosurgeon should you ever need one.  Don't hesitate to see him. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
