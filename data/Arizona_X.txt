2	-1	 Very inexperienced. Merely a resident; still learning. Tried to answer questions, but truly didn't know the answers. Would be much more respected by admitting this. Very egotistical- this shows because he holds the attitude that his patients wouldn't know any differently. Just a student; not board certified. If continued learning would be his focus, he could have potential. He's under the belief that book knowledge equals intelligence, wisdom, intellect and experienced intuition; hence, the ego &amp; immaturity. An experienced and wise physician acknowledges his fallibility and will humbly not assume that he automatically earns a patients respect, especially a patient who knowingly has lived &amp; experienced the medical condition, and not just acquired some knowledge through a book or studying. I would not recommend this man, until his ego &amp; attitude turn to learning, as opposed to trying to uphold a fabricated image to a patient who can easily see through his self-created false-reality.  	5	1	1	1	Insurance:United HealthcarePaid/Co-pay:N/A
