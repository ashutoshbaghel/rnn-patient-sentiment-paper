1	-1	He was always fishing and never had time to see me. His nurse took care of everything and always had to call him on his cell phone to make sure she was doing everything that needed to be done.  	1	1	1	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

2	1	I went to Dr Kadish when i couldn't  take my heel pain anymore. I am a runner and the pain became so bad that I had to stop running. I went to Dr Kadish and he informed me of my plantar fashiatis. He gave me a steroid shot and my feet felt brand new! I am so thankful I went and got my life back. Running is my passion and without him I would have never been able to get back to normal. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
2	1	I was really nervous about seeing a doctor for my foot pain. I had been living with my bunion and the pain that came with it for years. My friend told me about Dr. Kadish. She said he was really nice and gentle so I mustered up to courage to see him. He told me that the procedure was simple and I didnt have to live with pain. Its been a year and a half since my surgery and I could not be happier! I love him! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
2	0	$2505.00 apiece for the first 3 Office Visit&#63; Absolutely outrageous. After 3 visits I left and went elsewhere (suggested by my Insurer).. This place seems more interested in money than curing the patient. There are many other Podiatrists in the City. 	1	1	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown
3	1	This office has no idea what's going on. The office visit was pleasant, but there follow-up is horrible. They were supposed to contact me in a given time period on my results. Since the given amount of time had lapsed I called them to find that they don't know of any results or anything from my last visit. I was swapped between 3 ppl in a given call and had to remind them of what test where taken and what went on. Isn't that why you have a file&#63; Overall I am very displeased... It's taxing enough having to visit an oncologist, but for them not being able to recollect the services they rendered is unacceptable. 	1	1	2	5 	Insurance:Unknown
3	1	Showed concern and was very gentle in examination.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
4	1	I love love love Dr. Kirby.  I never has someone be so thourough with me and he always helps improve my vision. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
4	1	Dr Kirby is very polite and very knowledgeable.He really cares for his patients. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
4	1	I'll admit I was hesitant to go to Wal-Mart for eyecare. But after a really bad experience at another optometrist, I went to Dr. Kirby's office at the Wal-Mart Vision Center. The wait for my appointment was less than ten minutes and the reception staff was efficient and courteous. The doctor was also pleasant and thorough. He listened to my concerns and made sure everything was good with my eyes. I had a comprehensive exam and a contact lens exam. I highly recommend this eyecare team. The price is very reasonable for the high level of care given. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
5	1	I was incredibly impressed with Dr. Kaliebe when I saw her today, for the first time.  I got right in, and she saw me right away.  The staff was very helpful and courteous.  I found Dr. Kaliebe to have a lovely bedside manner, and it was clear to me that she is very smart and thorough in her approach.  I would highly recommend her and will continue to see her.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
5	1	Been going to her for over 4 years for osteoporsis.  Find her thoughtful and professional.  Called me with results, and explained them carefully.  Conservative approach, evaluates you and does a good work up. Did not rush me into any decisions.  Seems very knowledgable. 	4	4	4	5 	Insurance:Unknown

5	-1	Terrible bedside manners.  Does not listen to patient issues nor look in detail at records.  	2	3	1	1 	Insurance:Humana
5	-1	She mis diagnosed me, then did no follow-up.  I almost died because of her mismanagement of my care.  She is a cold, heartless dotor. 	1	2	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	This doctor cancelled two appointments I had the day before. And with no reason. Do not see this doctor if you want her to show up.  	5	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
7	-1	This is the worst dr. I have ever seen.  He prescribed a medicine he knew I was highly allergic to and a second drug that should not be taken with another drug that he knew I was taking. He was very unprofessional and I am not sure how he passed medical school. Stay as far away from him as you can.  He ran tests that wer expensive and unnecessary for my treatment.  Thank goodness I have good insurance so the money was not technically coming out of my pocket but Blue Cross needs to watch the tests that he runs and be sure they are necessary.  He made me very nervous being in his presence and asked many inappropriate questions.   Stay away from him because the next time he mis-prescribes a medicine it could result in the death of a patient 	3	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

9	1	Usually relatively easy to get appmt, and Dr Kemp seems to strive to see patients on time.  Dr Kemp always takes time to understand patient complaints, and to discuss diagnosis in detail.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
9	1	It's true Dr. Kemp is very attentive to his patients. You have his full attention and he never rushes you and he is never rushed. He doesn't over book his day so there's never a long wait. His office staff and nursing staff is A-1 as well. I highly recommend him to everyone.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
9	1	Dr. Kemp is very attenative to his patients....and he actually listens to what they have to say regarding their concerns. He's never rushed and you have his undivided attention. He takes the time to explain the medical situation to you. And then lets you ask questions. Dr. Kemp doesnt over book his day do that leaves quality time for each patient. You don't find many doctors that provide this level of care in this day and time. He truly cares about his patients and goes the extra mile for them.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
9	1	I would recommend Dr Kemp to anyone looking for healthcare in Denham Springs. He is a wonderful doctor. I have been seeing him for more than 5 years now.  		4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
9	1	Very personable. Takes time to hear your complaint. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
10	1	Dr.Knecht has the most professional and caring I have ever encountered in a physician. He is great with kids and with adults as well. Other physicians go to him and he is a great diagnostician. He will point you in the right direction for a specialist.  I know two people for whom and has discovered cancers at a much earlier stage than most physicians, according to the cancer centers they later attended.  He will personally check up on you and WILL answer his home phone if you call him.  He will also meet you at the emergency room when necessary.  His staff is super nice and knowledgeable.  In addition, he has a great sense of humor. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
10	1	VERY SMART, FRIENDLY, FUNNY AND EASY TO TALK TO. HAS A WAY OF PUTTING PEOPLE AT EASE. BETTER WITH KIDS THAN ANY PEDIATRICIAN I'VE EVER SEEN. WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR THE BEST FAMILY DOCTOR IN TOWN! 	 7/27/07	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
11	-1	Doctor refused to see me because I forgot my insurance card. I had the insurance company on the phone and they wanted to tell them that they authorize the visit and will pay, but the receptionist refused to talk to them. This doctor's office is all about the money, not relieving suffering.  	1	1	1	3 	Insurance:Humana
11	1	Been going to Dr.Robert for years and have found him to be very concerned and always tries to find a solution to complaints. Has sent me to other Drs. when he feels that the problem can be better taken care of by another.  Always tries to give samples! 	4	4	5	4 	Insurance:United Healthcare
11	1	I am so happy I found Dr. Koppel.  He treated me like a person, and I am so grateful.   And funny too! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

16	1	I've been with Dr. Keefer for several years, and she is SO knowledgeable and thoughtful in her diagnoses. You can tell she really loves what she does. And she tests for Vitamin D deficiency. Not many doctors do that. You will probably have to wait even with a scheduled appointment, but it'll be worth it once you get in there because she doesn't rush you through like she's in a hurry to get you out the door and get paid. She's careful and very purposeful about what she does.  And she loves the 'dem Saints! :) (Date: 09/2011) 	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	1	A super doctor!  Anyone with an MD and a PhD in science is excellent in my book. 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	Dr. Keefer is an excellent diagnostition.  He bedside manner is more straight forward than warm &amp; fuzzy, but she is very nice, and an excellent doctor.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
17	1	Kelleher is very prompt and direct; she doesn't speak in riddles. She noticeably enjoys her job and is proud of her work. She is willing to do what she can to help and is not just &quot;in it for the money.&quot; Her knowledge is definitely vast and she will hold a technical conversation if you so wish. Her personality and attitude, towards her patients and her work, couldn't be better.  Going to the doctor isn't so bad for once! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

18	1	I would recommend Dr. Kilpatrick to anyone. He's the most caring, attentive doctor I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. I'd been bounced back and forth from doctor to doctor for some issues that a lot of doctors wrote off, but that were causing me pain and discomfort nearly every day. Dr. Kilpatrick is the only one who sat down and listened to what I had to say without cutting me off with some premature diagnosis. (This often happens to me since I'm a female in my early 20's and a lot of docs are quick to shrug off my complaints.) He saw me specially, even though he wasn't taking new patients at the time because my husband worked at the hospital where he consults and had told him about my issues. (He's well-liked among hospital staff, too.) He spent AN HOUR AND A HALF in the exam room with me, which is probably about equal to the combined time I spent with numerous other doctors. I was wowed by his bedside manner and thorough exam. I would recommend him to anyone, any time.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

Even though the extraction went well, very easy, not impacted, and all I was supposed to take was Advil for the pain, this didn't stop it from turning into a major problem.  Thanks a lot for nothing, and for not paying attention to my mouth.  	5	4	3	2 	Insurance:Humana

She sent me for lab work &amp; immediately diagnosed me being in a Thyroid Storm from (Graves disease) &amp; said my AIC registered ll.  I had no idea I was a diabetic! With her knowledge &amp; great care my STORM has past, my AIC is now 5.9 &amp; diabetis is completely under control (with over a 50 pound weight loss). She is a brilliant Endocrinologist, extremely personable, understanding &amp; caring &amp; I can't say enough about both &amp; Sammie both! I highly recommend this Dr &amp; think her staff is top of the professional LIST! I thank God for each of them!

27	1	This doctor is dedicated and genuinely sincere.  You have his undivided attention when he is with you and your health (physically and mentally) is his main concern. Likewise, he will address all of your concerns to the best of his ability. He listens when you speak and response is always filled with compassion and understanding.  He recognizes you when he enters the room and does not hesitate when calling your name.  I wish I could see him for all illnesses.  My other doctors have a tough act to follow and have not yet stepped up to the plate.  He is an excellent human being and this makes him a wonderful doctor and friend.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

29	-1	He was great on my first visit but was a completely different person the next.  In the end, I decided to post my experience here to help anyone else considering him as a physician.  All in all, he was VERY unprofessional and unhelpful. 	1	4	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
29	-1	Went to office for appointment, filled out paperwork, gave i.d. to lady at desk and she rudely returned it when my son said&quot; She was rude!&quot;  I told him people are like that sometimes.&quot;  She then came almost across the counter and aske rudely if I was talking about her.  I told her what my son said and she calld me all kinds of profanity, INSIDE THE OFFICE WITH MY SON WATCHING AND MY ROOMMATE IN THE WAITING ROOM WATCHING TOO!!! She was very unprofessional and very, very hard on my child.  I don't see how you can have employees that act like that in your office.  I figured there would be better service if they were wanting payment for services, but I left without even seeing the doctor.  With service like that, who wants to see the Doctor anyways&#63;  You are judged by the people you meet in the front office and if anyone meets her, they will see the same things I saw. 	1	2	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown

37	-1	I've never been able to communicate with this doctor; he's always got to &quot;leave town&quot;.  He claimed to be a Myasthenia Gravis specialist, but after four years of neglect, avoidance, and lack of communication, he's finally told me that I may &quot;need to see a specialist&quot;.  The level of incompetency Karim carries is exhausting.  He never orders prescriptions when he's supposed to, he never follows up unless he's hounded for days, he's always incommunicado, and never returns calls.  If anyone in the Lafayette area is looking for a good doctor needs to focus their efforts on AVOIDING Dr. Wael Karim.  If not for other doctors able to pull his slack in my time of crisis, I very well would have died in the ER just before my appointment with Karim which he didn't keep, because he had to &quot;leave town,&quot; which was a lie. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
38	1	Dr. Katz was a pleasure to work with.  His demeanor was exactly what I want looking for, and his knowledge of spine and back problems really educated me as to what I needed to do to correct my issues.  When selecting a surgeon, I want someone who understands the latest medical technologies and who can do the least invasive operation possible.  Dr. Katz explained very well what needed to be done and how soon I could be back to work.  Now, I am scheduled to fix my problems with a procedure called a Microscopic Discectomy, and I will be back to work in no time.  His website,http://westsideortho.comis very educational and has lots of reference materials, videos and illustrations.  I highly recommend Dr Ralph Katz if you are having ANY back problems.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

She is the doctor, your questions about any detailed plans of how the treatment will play out or any request that you might have are simply a wast of your breath &amp; a wast of her time. She does not care... And if you question her you will see the deer in the headlight eyes,, run that was your warning, don't fall for it, get out while you can and do not give her permission to preform surgery. As you can tell I have no respect for this person. And yes that is from experience. 	4	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
43	1	LOVE her so much! She is a wonderful person and doctor. The staff is amazing and so friendly. Had two children with her practice (one with Dr Padgett and one with Dr Kennedy...LOVE them BOTH!) and we had to move out of state.  Very sad to leave them!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

44	1	Went to Dr King originally for issues that resulted in surgery.  Ultimately I thought that I needed a 2nd opinion from another ENT - wish I hadn't.  She's great and will spend as much time as you like discussing your issues, reviewing details of CT scans, etc.  My second opinion doc walked in, said, &quot;CT Looks ok to me&quot; and left.  Glad to have Dr King.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
45	-1	horrible experience.  Went in to finally treat myself for my  50th bd.  Wanted my jowls lifted.  she recommended I have a thread lift, cheek implants, eyelid surgery, and a forehead lift.  Well I still have my jowls, just as bad and I now have from the surgery a damaged nerve in my lip, which causes it to not have feeling (very annoying feeling).  And I have these crazy bumps under one eye and a skin tag thingy on bottom of other eye (both of which I did not have before she operated on me).  They said they would fix the problems, but just give me the run around.  His office is extremely rude once they get your money, and actually lied to me (when I requested to cancel due to my son's illness) and told me I would not get my $500.00 back if I cancelled.  Even though it was written you could cancel at that time and recieve your deposit back.  In addition, the papers describing the procedure they were to do said exactly what would be accomplished and when I showed them this they changed it! 	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

47	1	I agree with the LDN comments from a previous rater-- he refused to treat me if I wanted to continue with it (and it WAS helping)-- I now do the Tysabri infusion once monthly-- which I don't have any copay on, but he gets paid bundles every month from my ins.  And I don't really see any improvement, afer a year- felt better on the LDN. I see his PA every few mos. (who is VERY nice and efficient)- Have only seen him twice/year. My opinion of him is mixed. Very closed-minded and brusque- and seems to have built himself a mini-empire- a &quot;medi-mall&quot;, with lots of treatment and diagnostic facilities within his kingdom. But he is better than what I had previously, so I am holding out and hoping. I stay mostly because of his terrific PA! (other staff&#63; so-so, depending on their mood).  He knows MS, very familiar with what it does to a person-- but not so willing to venture outside of big-Pharmna (where the $'s are&#63;) 	3	4	3	4 	Insurance:Humana
47	0	Ordered tests (MRI, bone density) but did not review reports and did not discuss until I asked. Very closed minded and unwilling to think about anything that wasn't aggressively pushed by the drug companies. Wants to be considered an MS specialist but I question his motivation. Was his patient for approx 6 years but changed when he refused to acknowledge that LDN was indeed helping me (read MRI reports indicated marked improvement since starting LDN).  	4	4	2	3 	Insurance:Medicare
47	1	If you are not a textbook case, he will not likely to help you. His analytical ability may be above average among Baton Rouge doctors, but he seems to be afraid of using it. Otherwise he is agressively treating the disease once he diagnosed it. 		4	3	4 	Insurance:Unknown

53	1	I came to dr. Khoobehi for breast augmentation because I have several friends who got perfect results and recommended him to me. My initial consultation went great. He was honest, not just telling me what I wanted to hear. My pre-op consult went even better. I was terrified of surgery and both Dr. Khoobehi and his staff told me exactly what to expect and calmed my nerves completely. I left feeling great about the upcoming surgery. The operation went so smooth. I followed doctor's orders to the tee and I was never really in any pain following the surgery. It has been 2 weeks since the operation and the results are FLAWLESS!! My breasts are perfection! They are just what I wanted, exactly what I asked for and he even fixed a few minor problems I had had with my original breasts using his superb knowledge and skills with the placement of the implants. I recommend him to everyone who will listen. Truly the best in Louisiana, maybe the country. Thank you Dr. Khoobehi!! I'm so happy!! 	 3/13/12	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	Dr. Khoobehi &amp; his staff were very professional &amp; polite. He answered every question i had great. He took time to listen and answer everything to the best of his knowledge. He makes you feel very comfortable with talking to him. I would def. recommend him to others. 	 1/6/12	5	4	5	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	Dr. Khoobehi and his staff were amazing. My breast augmentation recovery time was minimal.  I had slight soreness with very little pain.  My breasts look and feel very natural.  I was very pleased with the results. Dr. Khoobehi was so kind and he truly has an eye for perfection. My breasts are perfect and symmetrical. He is a great surgeon. Also, I must comment on how wonderful his staff is. They were so friendly and called me several times after surgery to check on my recovery. GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!! 	 10/10/11	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	I had 2 sessions of smart lipo done. I am very happy with the results.  Dr. Khoobehi was professional, easy to talk to, and communicated well regarding expectations.  I would do it again in a second. 	 9/30/11	5	3	5	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	I had my silicone breast implants removed.  Dr. Khoobehi did lipo suction to my entire mid section and a tummy tuck.  He used some of the lipo fat to fill in the breast.  If I want bigger breasts I would need to return in 3 months for more injections.  When removing silicone breast implants there is a healing period before he can insert fat.  I had the surgery in February.  I am extremely pleased with the results.  I have a flat stomach now and my own breasts.  I was surprised but Dr. Khoobehi was able to do this and reconstruction of the top layer of my breasts.  Everything looks great.  I am extremely pleased with the results.  I am not pleased with how my belly button turned out but he is fixing that next week and can do it right in his office.  Dr. Khoobehi is kind and has a wonderful bedside manner.  He made me feel he was listening and interested in the results.  He agrees with me that I don't need any additional surgery as my breasts look beautiful just a little smaller. 	 9/26/11	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

The only thing that out shines Dr. K's skills is his honesty.  If he doesnt think a certain procedure you are requesting will give you the results you are looking for, he will tell you.  I have a friend, that because of cost went to the &quot;lowest bidder&quot; (but a well known plastic surgeon in the the area)...she has regretted it ever since.  Dr.Khoobehi is a perfectionist in his work and truly cares about his patients...no other plastic surgeon in New Orleans even comes close. 	 5/21/11	5	4	5	Insurance:Unknown
53	0	first off, the doctors work came out good. my wife had a breast augmentation and we are both satisfied. Now, would i recommend him to anyone else&#63; absolutely NOT. i'm guessing English wasn't his first language- due to the fact he lacks in his communication skills. after waiting over an hour for the consultation, he then proceeded to rush through it like his dinner was on fire in another room. we get the procedure scheduled, he preforms the operation and it turns out well. a week later, we go in for the post-op follow up.Strikes 2 and 3! Let me say, the Doc was one inappropriate comment away from getting his face pounded in.women that come to you are SELF CONSCIOUS enough already, they don't need some MD prick spamming off color remarks. we were in a salon the other day. in here were a few hair-dressers who compared our experience with some of the others they heard about. wouldn't you know&#63; they all matched up. &quot;Dr. Khoobehi is VERY arrogant&quot; followed by &quot;i strongly do NOT recommend!&quot; 	5	1	2	4 	Insurance:Unknown
53	-1	I went to Dr.khoobehi 4years ago for implants. I told him I wanted a full D I'm a small c. He would never tell me the size he would give me he would only tell me it's not the size of the breast, and I could always go bigger. I was never pleased since day one, when I called to get a price to get them redone he told me 8-10 thousand! No wonder he told me I could always go back to get bigger. I am now paying another doctor for him to give me what I asked for 4years ago. 	1	3	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown

53	-1	Dr. Khoobehi made me feel horrible about myself and I left his office in tears. I have a mild case of pectus excavatum. I have also always had very small breasts. I have ALWAYS wanted breast augmentation. I went for a consult with him. I waited almost 2 hours just to see him. He didn't even introduce himself before opening the robe and telling me how bad he thought my cheat wall deformability was. He never asked me what I wanted to achieve by having surgery or my concerns. He just told me I was NOT a candidate for breast augmentation. He told me I needed a $13,000 fat graphing surgery and it MIGHT make me go up by one cup size, at the most! He also told me, &quot;If you find a plastic surgeon who tells you they can successfully give you implants, they are lying to you&quot;. I left his office in tears. I saw 3 more surgeons after that and they all told me the exact opposite. I have since had saline breast implants by a very qualified and skilled ps and they look AMAZING! Dr. K is a joke!!! 	2	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
53	0	On two separate occassions I had botox injections.  The first time my left eye lid was slightly droopy.  I was told this was a highly unusual side affect and that it would go away.  It did after a couple of weeks.  Becasue it was considered so unusual I figured it would not happen again.  WRONG.  18 months later I went back for the same proceedure.  This time my right eye is so droopy I can barely see.  Not only is my right eye droopy but the vision muscles are weakended and my vision is impared. I look like a freak.  People think I've had a stroke.  Everything I've looked at says that droopy eye is due to poor or untrained injection technique.  the fact that it happened twice from the same doctor on two different eyes tells me that its not me, its him.  It has been 6 weeks and I still look like Forest Whitaker. Also he left both me and my friend extreemly bruised after juviderm filler.  bruises took almost 2 weeks to go away. 	4	5	3	2 	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	Dr Khoobehi is awesome. He is a great listener and very helpful with providing me with all of the information I needed for fraxel treatment. Lisa took very good care of me. The staff was super friendly. Also, I love the decor of Dr Khoobehi's practice. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	I would have to disagree with many comments that have been made. I went to the consultation for a breast implant procedure. He listened to everything i wanted, and actually told me that i did not need implants nor a lift.Of course he is in it for the money, this is his career, but hes not out just to take your money. If that was the case I would have gotten the surgery done. In my opinion great doctor and staff 	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
53	-1	The absolute worst communication.  Privacy and concern for patients welfare the absolute worst!  If you like your situation discussed in the waiting area with other people you don't know you will love this office.  The last time I saw Dr Khoobehi or anyone on his staff was after a 5,500.00 procedure.  I wasn't doing very well after and returned for my follow up appointment.  I was upset and even crying during the follow up appointment.  After I left that day nobody from this office called to check on me and it's been 4 months.  I will NEVER use him again because of the lack of concern, professionalism, and communication. 	1	3	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
53	1	Did breast lift and fat injections to breast.  I am not happy with the results.   4 months after surgery breasts dropped and deflated.  It has been almost 3 years and still not pleased with results and i am looking to have another lift with small implants. 	3	3	4	3 	Insurance:Unknown

53	-1	I scheduled an appt. to consult on getting a filler. I sat in the office over an hr. and was never acknowledged until I went up to the front desk and asked the receptionist how much longer I had to wait. She said maybe 15 to 30min. I left and said How unprofessional and what lack of courtesy- I came in on time for my scheduled appt and yet the dr. doesn't give me the time of day. Just b/c I'm not getting the filler today doesn't mean i won't be getting one. I had questions before getting this procedure done. They just want you're money up front and have no bedside manner. Unprofessional. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
53	-1	I went in for a breast augmentation. I was a natural 34B and wanted to go up 1 cup size. He immediately recommended that I go up to a full D. After the surgery, I ended up being a 34DD and was unhappy with the enormous size, as well as my breast being uneven. He ignored my special requests and charged me for services he did not perform. He was a nice doctor, but it did not seem to matter to him what the patient wanted. It's been 6 years since I had my surgery, and I am still unhappy with his work. 	3	3	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown

He says he doesn't know what happened, and it looks like I need another fix.  I paid a lot of money, he did the work, and if he doesn't know what happened, I guess I am screwed.  I cannot afford to do this again right now.  Next time I am going somewhere else to get it done right way I hope. 	4	4	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown

53	0	Please do not use him for injectable fillers.  He overcharges compared to other professionals for the same service, and he is not as good as the others in the area.  He is heavy-handed and overinjects resulting in deformities in some area. He doesn't like to listen when you tell him what you want.  You can see the faraway look in his eye as you talk, then he interrupts you and does what he wants, and not what you ask.   You cannot talk to him about your disappointment with his work because he will question your &quot;mental state&quot; and then turn his back on you and walk away.  It is painful to be overcharged so much money to try to look good, and then look worse than you did when you went in, and he doesn't want to acknowledge his own mistakes.  There are better doctors in the area who are more caring and not arrogant and who charge a fair price, and you actually look great when you leave their offices, compared to this person. 	3	2	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown
53	-1	Staff not very good with communcation.  Do not always get back to you.  Usually I wait ~ 30 minutes to see doctor, which affects my busy schedule.  Staff not always knowledgeable and I have been given incorrect information by receptionist before.  Receptionist also pulled wrong chart when I was there and gave doctor chart of a woman with a similar last name as I have.  This caused a confusion, but i caught the error when I peeked into the chart. Also they are not forthcoming with actual charges.  I was quoted for $550 for syringe of Juvederm under eyes after consultation with Dr. But after injection, I was charged $750. When i inquired, I was told &quot;It is $200 extra for 'under the eyes.&quot;  I was disappointed because of surprise additional charge and also that I suffered with long bags and ridges under my eyes for five months before I went to dermatologist to inject enzyme to remove them.  Otherwise, he is good with Botox and good surgeon, though I am left with visible scars on breasts. 	3	2	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown

56	-1	Came to see Dr. Khan with stomach problems (gastritis). After preliminary tests showed no major issues Dr. Khan suggested biopsy and scoping. Office manager said it would cost $800. The whole amount had to be paid upfront (due to our Blue Cross Blue Shield high deductible plan&#63;). No new findings were made during and after procedure. But the total charges swelled up to close $3500 including $800 Dr Khan charges, $1000 hospital, $500 anesthesia, hundreds from labs. The end result - the same prescription drug as before, the same stomach problems, and hefty profits for the doctors, their offices, and the hospital we had to pay due to high deductible.

They answer the phone, &quot;Pediatric Associates of Shreveport please hold&quot; and put you on hold before you say one word. They also take your credit card while you are in the waiting room and do not return it until you are leaving. Dr. Kendrick does not have a good bedside manner. The last two times I've taken my baby in for a well check Dr. Kendrick kept his back to us for most of the visit. He would talk over his shoulder and ask me questions regarding my son, but didn't make eye contact. When he examined my son, he did it so quickly that if there were actually something wrong, he wouldn't have caught it. He spent all of 2 or 3 minutes in the room with us. He also told me that I should allow my 6 month old baby to cry it out during the night, because he is &quot;plenty old&quot; to be sleeping through the night. I disagree completely.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

If you come in w/2 or more concerns, she will only address 1 in order to bill you/insurance comp./medicaid for repeated visits. If you're paying cash, these charges add up!!

He spent a lot of time talking and asking questions in our appointment and then he followed up with calls at home.

68	-1	Dr. Kleinpeter delivered our baby and shoved gauze pads with forceps into my wife's rectum because he did not want to smell her feces. REALLY&#63; Please change professions if you don't care to give the best care to your patients.  	2	3	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
68	1	Delivered my first, and did very well.  Currently seeing him for my third.  (Our second was born in Lake Charles.)  I was very pleased in his frankness, confindence, and kindness.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
68	1	Dr. K delivered my son 3 years ago and I am now 29 weeks pregnant and under his care. My husband and I both think he is a great doctor, I had Fifth's Disease when pregnant with my son and Dr. K probably saved his life. I really can't say enough nice things about him... he is like a friend and makes me feel completely comfortable. He always takes time to listen to my questions and concerns. I was really surprised to read an unfavorable review about him on here...he must have been having a REALLY bad day because that is not his normal behavior at all! Two thumbs up for Dr.  Kleinpeter!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
68	-1	I waited 4 months to get in to see him.  I was looking forward to my appt. because I'd heard such great things about him, but I was very disappointed.  He barely spent any time with me, and when I asked for a specific kind of birth control, he said neither he nor any of his partners could prescribe it.  Apparently, he doesn't do diaphragm fittings at all and won't prescribe them for his patients.  Instead, he sent me out with a pamphlet on a different kind of hormonal birth control that, according to the pamphlet, isn't recommended for me and one I told him I didn't want.  He also wouldn't refer me to another doctor who could provide what I was requesting.  He walked out on me in mid-sentence.  I had to find another doctor and make an appointment with him to get what I went in to see him for.  Frustrating and very disappointing. 	5	2	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Loved the bed side manner. He delivered my sisters 1st and my 2nd child. Very knowledgable. I will not be going to any other OB/GYN. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Dr. K is very down to earth and attentive. He will spend as much time listening and offering advice as needed.  He rocks! 		4	5	5 	Insurance:Humana

68	1	Dr. Kleinpeter is also a fertility specialist. We - and our new baby son - highly recommend him. He is one of the best doctors I've ever been to. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
69	1	Dr. Kevill is knowledgeable, kind, and caring.  My child loves him and insists we go to tell him &quot;hello&quot; whenever we are visiting another doctor in the same office building.  Wish there were more doctors like him around! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

71	1	I had my breast surgey in October 1993. Now, 18 years later, I am still very happy with everything Dr. Knight did for me and the way the payment was handled as well! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
71	1	he did a breast augmentation on me after two other plastic surgeons thought it would be too difficult 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
71	1	I had mommy makeover and my result were amazing! I would do over in a heart beat. Plus everyone was so very nice. I didnt have sweeling in my stomach my breast look amazing. The staff and surgical center were very nice and caring. It was a very pleasant experience which sounds odd b/c you would think it was painful. My stomach only burned a little and my breast did hurt near as bad as I had read, there were more sensitive than anything. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
71	1	Staff and physician very knowledgeable and professional. Made me feel very comfortable and I had an excellent result with my breast augmentation. He has the reputation of being the best breast and body contouring surgeon in the area and after my experience and those of my friends that have seen him I understand why. His fees are reasonable also, SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than what the Wall Center charges. Overall very very happy and would recommend highly. Don't understand the comments in the other review. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
72	1	He is so professional and concerned.  I like the fact that he asks the right questions, but is not an alarmist.  He has experience, but is up-to-date on newest research and findings. 	3	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
73	1	Wonderful doctor.  Busy, but you would never know it by the personal attention he gives you.  I have recommended him to several friends and they have recommended him also.  That says it all.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Humana

74	-1	I can only reason that the dr. was uninterested in my parents needs.  he was uncooperative and unavailable for questions i needed towards the end of my fathers life.  he looked liked he would be there for my family, but he wasn't.  	1	1	1	3 	Insurance:Aetna
75	1	Dr. Kiernan is the most compassionate doctor we have dealt with.  He is very thorough and takes a great deal of time with his patients.  I have never felt rushed during visits and have never had trouble getting in to see him.  Also, he KNOWS my kids- not just their diagnosis and records, but their personalities.  He knows how to talk to them, reassure them, explain to them.  My kids actually look forward to seeing him! When my son was facing a very unusual diagnosis, it was Dr. Kiernan who devoted himself to finding the right specialist and the right care for him.   We feel extremely blessed to have him in our corner! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

77	1	I really like this DR.  He's got a wonderful bedside manner & has a lot of compassion for his patient 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
78	1	He is a great doctor and accusations listed in previous rating are all false and looks that it is based on personal attack related to his religion.  It is not based on his capabilities and knowledge as an outstanding doctor but rather reflecting the rater's animosity and unfairness. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

81	1	I saw Dr. King from when I was 10 to when I was about 14 for scoliosis. He is an amazing doctor. He's extremely knowledgeable yet down-to-earth. He truly cares about his patients and their families. I ended up needing surgery to correct my scoliosis. I can honestly say that I would not have trusted any other doctor to perform my surgery. Aside from his practice, he is a professor at LSU's medical school &amp; he also conducts research on scoliosis &amp; other areas in orthopedics. I could not have asked for a better doctor. I HIGHLY recommend him. If you see him, you are truly receiving premium care.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
82	1	Dr. Koppel haa always been extremely helpful during my office visits.  He is very knowledgeable and takes time to listen to what I have to say.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
82	1	I have been very happy with Dr. Koppel. He is always been very caring and helpful. He is a good listener and is concerned about his patients.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unicare
82	0	Doug was more helpful in explaining medical conditions than other derms I had been to but was unsuccessful in treating my condition. Also, every time I visited the office I was seen excessively late (1+ hours after the appointment time). When approached about this Doug was rude, suggested that he always ran this late, and said that if I wanted to be seen on time I should get the first appointment of the day. 	1	1	1	4 	Insurance:Unknown
83	1	Dr. Kahn is a great doctor.  Been seeing him for years now.  He is very patient and will sit and listen to your issues.  He really seems to care about your wellbeing.  He even waited with me after hours to get test results.  Can't imagine many other doctors would do that!  Highly recommended.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
83	1	very helpful, checked out all complaints, really listened and was concerned about my wellbeing. Very kind. He gave me a complete exam and was very good diagnostician. 		4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

85	-1	I went to this doctor to find out why I could not get rid of a cough. she said I had asthma and kept increasing the dosages to the max and I still had a cough.

86	-1	This doctor did such a poor job on my mother's femoral bypass that it took a plastic surgeon two additional surgeries to try to correct the problem.  THEN after finding a lump in her breast this doctor put my 72 year old mother under general anesthesia with a half-day stay in the hospital for a needle biopsy!!  This is a 30-second procedure typically done in the doctor's office.  I feel like he milked Medicare by putting her in the hospital for such a minor procedure.  General anesthesia should not be taken as lightly as this &quot;doctor&quot; apparently takes it.  I would not send my dog to him, nor will my mother ever cross his doorstep again.  	2	2	1	1 	Insurance:Medicare
86	-1	My father went to this  doctor in 2008 with constipation problems test revealed that he had a hernia and he was admitted to Oschner Hospital for surgery Dr. Minnard   found a very dilated almost ischemic sigmoid colon the hernia was repaired and he was then closed up. Ten days later my father returned back to Oschner Hospital with severe abdominal pain fever and vomiting further test concluded that the same problem noted in his records ten days earlier was the cause of his pain but by this time the sigmoid colon was necrotic during this surgery his colon bursted and he developed sepsis and died three days later.. I don't think  Dr. Mark Kappleman isn't a very good  doctor due to this problem not being addressed sooner. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
86	-1	Do not use this ****. During Laparoscopic surgery on my dad this doctor nicked my dad’s intestine with one of his instruments which caused him to cut my dad in the shape of an upside down T, 4 inches across the belly button and up 6 inches, in order to repair the nick. After the surgery he told my family, “his gallbladder was inflamed so I had to cut him”. Later we learned, by mistake, the real reason the doctor cut my dad was to repair the damage he caused to my dad’s intestine. 	3	3	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown

92	1	Dr. Kablinger is a doctor with old fashioned principles. A rare gem in todays fast paced world. She not only sees patients at LSU but also teaches,is head of student training, does talk shows and helps out in crises such as the New Orleans disaster. She still sees neighbours next door, I know because I have been there, and takes food to patients who have none for Thanksgiving. She will write back to patients who need to hear from someone and I appreciated that. Dr. Kablinger is a blessing to all her patients. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

He and staff are very defensive  when asking questions about procedures and diagnosis.  	2	2	2	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
