1	1	Dr. Urbanek specializes in pediatric orthopedics. My son had back pain for months before we saw him. This doctor knew what was wrong right away and treated my son with a back brace. My son has been absolutley fine -- no pain -- for over 3 years. We are very grateful for his knowledgable, professional care. Highly recommended.  	 9/30/07	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
2	1	I've been going there for years. Dr Ura is a very good dentist and his staff is wonderful. I just wish he was on the preferred list of dentist that my insurance has so it would cut some of the out of pocket expense. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
