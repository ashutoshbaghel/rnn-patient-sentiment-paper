2	-1	did not spend any time with me, condescending attitude, dismissed my concerns 	4	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
2	-1	I do not recommend this psychiatrist.   He was short-tempered, impatient and   did not explain diagnosis. 	4	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
3	1	Great doctor, very warm and easy to talk to. Will take you seriously and give you a proper workup to find out what's going on. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
4	1	Best Pain Medicine Doctor. Take a while to get an appointment.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
4	1	Best Pain Doctor in Rhode Island.  He helped me so much with a surgical procedure for my back that it chaned my life! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
5	-1	POKED A HOLE IN MY EYE WHILE DOING ROUTINE CATARACT SURGERY, HAD TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER DR. TO HELP HIM .TOOK 4 HOURS TO REPAIR TEMP. NEEDED ANOTHER 3 HOUR OPERATION (BY DIFFERENT DR.) AND 6 MONTHS TO RECOVER. NEVER GAVE EXPLAINATION OR APPOLOGY.  BUT DID SEND ME A BILL! 	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:Medicare
5	1	Dr Brasch is an excellent doctor, he takes his time with you and is very knowledgable in all aspects of his care.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
5	1	Dr. Brasch was able to see me fairly quickly but was unable to do more than diagnose my problem of a clogged tear duct and refer me to a specialist.  He was very nice and I would certainly feel comfortable returning to him for more routine reasons such as eye exams.  	4	4	4	4 	Insurance:Aetna
6	1	I was wary when I had to switch from my longtime MD to another in the Hillside Family Medicine practise.My anxiety was allayed,however,by Dr.Behtash who is a very caring and professional physician.I first saw her when I was in crisis and she took as much time as needed to diagnose and treat me.She always followed up and worked well with my specialist.I wish she were in sole practise because I find Hillside,under the current management,to be frustrating and even incompetent.I was recently charged a missed appt.fee and was put through hoops for months before it was settled.Most of the MDs in the practise can waive this fee,but because Dr.Behtash is not a partner, she isn't allowed to.Instead I had to contact the billing specialist,Renee Bromley,who,despite repeated contact from me,never replied.It was only after Dr.Behtash intervened (the bill was put in collection!) that I got a reply from Ms.Bromley.This is not how any MD office should operate!Dr.Behtash is excellent;Hillside is not! 	2	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	I am a former patient of Hillside Family Community Medicine. In the summer of 2009, I spent 10 minutes in the Hillside Family Community Medicine appointment system planning to see Dr. Solmaz Behtash for the first time due to a severe fever, but then instead decided to visit urgent care and a specialist with whom I had history due to scheduling conflicts. Despite notifying Hillside of the conflict, the rationale for seeing a doctor with whom I had history and my need to cancel, I was charged $30.00 for this 10-minute stay in Hillside's appointment book. Though I was told this unreasonable fee could have been reversed by Dr. Behtash, it appears she saw fit not to do so as I requested the fee be waived multiple times but received three invoices in the two months following the canceled appointment. I cannot speak to Dr. Behtash's medical capabilities, but I can confirm that Hillside Medical's impersonal, cold and profit-driven behavior has ruined my desire to return to their practice. 	1	3	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
7	0	What a shrew. Always undermining my other doctors and made numerous catty remarks about my primary. I won't miss her.  	3	2	2	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
7	1	Dr. Barnard was my 3rd endocrinologist and the first to really listen. She consistenly went above and beyond the call of duty in coordinating my treatment of another interrelated illness with my out of state neuro. She is the only one who I believe really understands how my system reacts to illness, meds. I will miss her as, after 20 yrs., I had to find a new endo since she has retired. Dr. Barnard was my guardian angel.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
7	-1	Dr. Barnard is a very odd person.  She doesn't listen to anything you say and seems to be in her own little world.  I waited over an hour to see her and she misdiagnosed me.  I changed to another endocrinologist and am much happier.  Her front office staff person looked unkempt and was very unprofessional.  I wouldn't recommend this doctor to anyone.  	2	1	1	1 	Insurance:Tufts
8	1	All the nurses fuss over my kids like they are family.  It seems like the know everyone personally.  Dr. Bonner's appointments are never short, but they are always thorough and he always gives clear diagnosis.  I have learned so much from the way he talks through the symptoms and diagnosis that I rarely get overly concerned.  It's comforting to be armed with the knowledge of what to watch for in your kids.  He also has two young kids of his own and relates to a lot of parenting issues and shares his own experiences.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
9	-1	Paul Barber should not be called a doctor.  His idea of practicing medicine is pushing pills, and never requiring a physical.  My husband is now permanently disabled because of his negligence.   Stay away 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
10	1	Dr. Barkin has been our family dentist for nearly 20 years.  He has treated my family, my children, and now, their children. His diagnostic skills are right-on, his prices are below the average, he never makes you wait, and his staff is older, has been with him for a long time, and they are very helpful and pleasant. This guy actually tries to save you money rather than rip you off! He also caters to anxious patients, and my wife, who is fearful of dentistry loves him! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
11	1	she was very kind and gracious.   Very knowledgeable and engaging  OUTSTANDING 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Tricare
11	1	I have been going to Dr. Bradley for many many years and I would not trust anyone else near my eyes. I highly recommend Dr. Bradley and Victorian Eyecare to EVERYONE! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
12	-1	I was an established patient in severe difficulty.  I called the office and was told he could see me in a month, despite my explaining how bad things were.  If not for my family doctor sending me to the hospital, I don't know what would have happened.  	1	3	1	3 	Insurance:Medicare
12	1	Dr. Bader is very knowledgable and caring.  He has done well by me in my treatment regimine as well as the monitoring of my aortic valve disease, and ultimate referal to an excellent surgical team at Brigham and Wommen's in Boston.  I credit the South County Cardiology team and my Brigham and Women's team for saving my life.  And they continue to monitor my condition and progress to my satisfaction.  I think they are the modle of what CCardiologist should be.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
12	-1	Uncaring and unhelpful: failed to accurately diagnose my daughter because her symptoms were not exactly what he had read in his medical books. Thank God her pediatrician was more knowledgeable and ready to probe more.  	3	4	2	2 	Insurance:United Healthcare
12	0	I was in deep trouble and his staff gave me an appointment in two weeks and said to go to the ER if I thought I needed help before then.  	2	3	2	4 	Insurance:United Healthcare
12	1	Dr.Bader is very knowledgeable, funny, and caring. He takes the time to answer any/all questions and he explains things in layman's terms.  AWESOME doctor! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
12	1	A nice guy. LIstens, and works with patients so they understand things and they get a treatment plan they are comfortable with.  		4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
13	1	She has been my doctor at Linden tree for a while.For ri and its dearth of decent doctors she is well above average.  I would say the staff might be average but she is not and seems to have genuine concern 	3	4	4	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
13	-1	My first visit with her she told me I was &quot;obese&quot; ... I'm 13 lbs overweight, I argued it with her and she looked up my BMI on her chart which put me 1 box away from being Ideal weight then she grabbed my wrist and said &quot;you're small boned so you're more overweight than the chart is telling me. I got dressed and walked out.  I'm a size 8 since when does that make someone obese&#63; 	5	1	1	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
14	1	Dr. Lari is good and funny. He understands patients. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
15	1	Extremely knowledgeable and stays up to date on new procedures. Very approachable - takes the time to explain.  Very kind and caring.  Strongly recommended. 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

15	1	Very knowledgeable and helpful.  Cares about his patients and keeps up to date with the latest advances. 	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
15	-1	My mother had a endoscopy done by him. She almost died. She was in the hospital for 2 weeks. Stay away from him. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
16	-1	he had 2 receptionists. one was very polite, the other  acted like i killed her cat. I was sent here by my gyn, for a painful bladder condition. I was told, without him running any tests,that my pain comes from stress in my life(like my mother being divorced, my father dying 20 years ago etc).. he told me the condition the other Dr wants me tested for is not as common as everyone thinks. Even though in his waiting area was a handout on this condition and it states anywhere from 7-9 MILLION people suffer from this. I think he is not used to treating women,and not real familiar with the condition, so he was trying to blow smoke up in the air.(to put it nicely.) also was very uncomfortable when he sent my best friend out of the room, and asked about intimate matters, informing me of the &quot;other way to handle things&quot;...very innapropriate for a first visit. 	1	2	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
17	1	. very good eye doctor, I been going to him for 10 years 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
17	1	Very congenial, great staff, clean and bright. Concerned about strong sales pitch for vitamins, creams, procedures and extras that I was never told I needed before. Recommended contacts even though previous optometrist discouraged them due to astigmatism. After spending hundreds, found I couldn't tolerate them due to the astigmatism. Recently learned that he closed the local office without notifying me. Changing doctors... ! 	5	4	4	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
17	1	Dr brown is an OK Doc but his prices are through the roof especially for glasses and frames and contact. His diagnostic tests are also very expensive and he wants to run them when they are not necessary and not covered by insurance either. I go to him but I'm not so sure he's a great Doctor.  		3	4	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

20	1	I started going to Dr. Barry for my children many years ago.  I was asked why I didn't get my teeth done and I explained to them that I was a coward.  Well they all eased my fears and I go faithfully now twice a year without any anxiety.  Without Dr. Barry and his staff, who knows what shape my teeth would be in now.   My thanks to them!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
20	1	.  	3	5	4	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
20	1	I would recommend Dr. Barry to everyone.  My family has been seeing him for years and my kids never fear a dentist visit, whether it's for a cleaning, cavities, or other.  Excellent staff too, and never a long wait.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
20	1	The best.  Have been to many and rejected them all until Dr Barry 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
20	1	Dr. Barry is a phenomenal dentist. He is very open, unafraid to give an opinion about your situation, does excellent general dentistry work, and will quickly refer you to a good specialist when warranted. This is actually the first dentist I've ever liked.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Delta Dental
20	1	Dr. Barry has been my family dentist for years. He is the BEST dentist ever to have to go to without fear of pain. Very empathatic. Never, Never will you feel a needle from him.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
21	1	Dr.B saved my life when I was hospitalized in 1995 for double pneumonia. He knows what he's doing. I guess everybody has their own experiences in different situations. For me it was a positive one.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
21	1	He treated me while I was in town visiting family in RI.  I had a very severe Asthma attack and was admitted to Fatima Hospital ICU.  He was very nice, and helpful, his PA, and NP staff were also wonderful. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

22	1	I have seen several psychiatrists in my life and Dr. Bermon is by and large the best of the best.  I would highly recommend. 	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
23	0	The doctor is very unfriendly. It seems as though it was a burden for him that I was there. He barely says &quot;hello&quot; and the 2 times I have been there, he never says goodbye, or thank you, or have a good day, or nothing. He just gets up and leaves and lets his assistant finish up. I don't understand how someone like himself can be working in the service industry when he obviously does not like interacting with people. After my first visit, I though his unkindness was from a bad day he was having or maybe it was a sort of cultural difference I didn't understand, yet was willing to accept; but, after the second visit, I'm sure he just has horrible customer/human relations. I don't trust him. He said I had a cavity, so I requested 2 know where and if he could show me either on the x-ray or n a mirror. With replied with some saying it doesn't show in the x-ray and that I wouldn't be able to see it. He thus handed me the mirror. I had to play 20 questions to figure out where.  thumbs down!! 	2	3	2	3 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal

25	1	Not sure why people have rated him like this, only had a positive experience.  	5	5	5	4 	Insurance:Medicare
25	-1	This man needs help.  He is mentally ill, in my opinion.  Arrogant, nasty, and hasty to make diagnosese without any supporting information.  I fear for people he is treating, because I truly believe he causes more harm than good.  I wish the state would investiage him and take away his license.  STAY AWAY. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
25	-1	In my opinion, Burock is mentally disturbed.  Narcissistic, borderline, and totally lacking in compassion for anyone but himself and the huge amount of money he makes off of human suffering.  Run, don't walk, from this piece of garbage.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
25	-1	 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
25	-1	2 years after this arrogant, incompentent man misdiagnosed me, I'm still getting bills from his office.  He should have his medical license taken away. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
25	1	Helped my father with his symptoms of Alzheimer's, friendly team, very knowledgeable.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
25	-1	This is, in my opinion, the rudest doctor I have ever encountered in my entire life. He didn't believe what I told him, even though I was truthful. He mocked me, laughed at me, and told me that my primary doctor was treating me with the wrong medicine. I would never seek treatment from this awful man again.  		1	1	1 	Insurance:Tufts
26	1	Young guy, but very nice, professional, and knowledgeable. He seems to be very bright. I'd highly recommend him, but he seems to be very much in demand, so it may be hard to get an appointment without a referral.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
26	1	Dr Breiding is a very good doctor. His is knowledgeable, caring and patient.  The ladies in his office are very sweet and helpful too!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

27	1	Very nice and trustworthy doctor. Had my first check-up and already feel comfortable. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
28	1	Im quite surprised by these reviews below. Dr. Boyle has always been very accommodating. My whole family goes to her and she has helped us through some pretty difficult times. I would certainly recommend her to others. 	2	3	4	4 	Insurance:Unknown
28	-1	. does not always listen to what patient tells her about past medical history 	3	2	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
28	-1	horrible doctor. do NOT ever go to her. she is unwilling to listen, treats patients not as people but as money going into her pocket. she is rude, tactless and has a horrible bed-side manor. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. i have suffered unnecessary physical and emotional pain because of her &quot;treatment&quot;. this doctor is a joke, her license should be revoked immediately.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
28	-1	Treated like a number, attempted to up sell me on other exams/procedures, other than what I was there for. She will not return phone calls, will only talk to patients by office appointments (that means you have to take time off work even to ask a very simple question, office said her policy is to NOT speak to patients on the phone).  I refuse to lose money while she makes money for doing nothing.  She also only prescribed a 6 month supply on basic med that in my 25 years of taking it have always been prescribed a 1 year supply.  Beware, she and their office are only interested in $$$.  	2	2	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
28	-1	Doesn't seem to care anymore. Saw my 2 children, spent about 15 seconds with each, said &quot;probably just a virus, come back if not better in few days.&quot; 48 hours later, returned, saw different doctor in the practice, one child had reging ear infection, other had pneumonia. Both could have been on antibiotics and on way to recovery much sooner if Dr Boyle had bothered to even listen to their breathing or looked in their ears. I will not go to her again or reommend her to anyone.  	4	2	1	1 	Insurance:Tricare
28	1	Dr. Boyle is very kind and patient and in tune with the needs of her patients. She keeps going to the doctors office from being a stressful task. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
28	-1	Worst doctor I ever had. I switched to Wendy Regan, in the same office..SHE is wonderful. 'The Boyle' is someone I would never recommend to anyone. She doesn't want to hear a thing you say and gets aggrevated if you ask her any questions 		3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

31	1	Very knowledgable &amp; helpful. Dr. Bock really helped with my foot pain. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
31	1	Since the comassion centers are not going to open now then If Dr seth bock and  The so called compassion centers really cared and were not in it for the money they would contact the  Few patients that dont have caregivers and offer their services for free to come to my home and grow for me and pay for the growing just like they would of for the Compassion centers they want to open.Basically becoming my at home caregiver where it would be easier for me to keep tract of what they are up to.Summit medical center,Dr Seth Bock green leaf compassion center,Slater compassion center, These three chosen groups should be reaching out to patients to help us grow at home!!!If they really were in it to help patients then why hasnt even one of them stood up to help us AT HOME at their expense same thing as a compassion center just without lining their pockets! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

33	-1	Dr. Ordered all procedures as Medical instead of Routine even though I made it perfectly clear when making appointment and first meeting with Dr. It was just routine yearly, no problems. It took way too many phone calls to BC/BS, Dr.'s office to finally get someone to take another look at all this.  They said they are going to fix all this, we'll see. Dr. Was VERY argumentative, office staff listened.  	3	4	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

38	-1	He's very nice but I worry about the quality of patient care. He didn't notice cancer in 2 patients I know of: a woman who had a golf ball size tumor in her abdomen, and a man who had testicular cancer.  He had never been given the standard blood test for testicular cancer which is usually done at annual check-ups. 	2	2	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown

39	1	Dr Basler and staff have been excellent. As a sufferer of a rare connective tissue disorder finding knowledgable drs is tough let alone one willing to treat someone with such a condition. Dr basler made it a goal to learn about my disorder and devised the best course of treatment His attention and commitment to his patients makes him a true find in the medical field. I would highly, and have done already numerous times, recommend Dr Basler for all your chiropractic needs. He's worth the trip to East Greenwich! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

41	1	Dr. Beraha has been my son's pediatrician since he was born. I've always had a great deal of confidence in him. Unfortunately, my son is now 21 and has to change to an adult doctor. I'm sure it will be difficult to find one as good as Dr. Beraha.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
41	1	When my son was born he was seeing a different dr in the anchor medical office. I wasn't too thrilled with that dr and my son would flipp out screaming and yelling. One day we had to go in as a emergency and it was Dr Beraha. I than switched to Dr. Beraha as his dr. I have talked friends into switching their kids over and told people who are pregnant and unsure of drs about him being the best. He is the dr to my 3 kids now and i just told him he will be adding a new patient in feb2010..

41	1	Dr. Nathan Beraha has been our sons cardiologist since shortly after he was born.  Not only do we find him incredibly knowledgable but he is also compassionate in how he treats our child.  He takes the time to explain things in a manner in which we completely understand him and he always encourages us to ask as many questions as we'd like.  We have the upmost respect for him and gladly refer him to anyone needing pediatric or cardiology care.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
41	1	He is a very pleasant doctor who is not intimidating at all for a child to communicate.He does not rush through his visit with you and makes you feel very comfortable. He took the time to explain everything and his office was very helpful in making all the arrangements. I would recommend him to any of my family or friends.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
41	1	Dr. Beraha is a wonderful Pediatrician. I couldn't ask for a better doctor for my daughter. Not only does he take his time to find out exactly how she feels physically but emotional as well. He talks to us as a family to work through any issues that we may be having with our daughter. If you are a first time parent he is the best doctor around.  He reassures me that I am not crazy, that you are just the parent of a three year old 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

43	0	This guy only does knee replacements these days, because he cares ONLY about 'where the money is.'  While he is surgically competent, he does all his procedures at Fatima Hospital  (where he is chief).  They use Associates in Anesthesia, a group that apprently trained using the tactics of Nazis.  They threaten people if you don't pay on time, are verbally abusive, rude &amp; uncaring.  I will NEVER go to Fatima again based on the way A of A treated me.   The office manager there, Cheryl, is a nasty, horrible person who told me I shouldn't have had my surgery if I coudln't pay the bill all at once (I was willing to pay it in 3rds every month for 3 months, but this wasn't acceptable to her...she informed me that I either had to pay up all at once, or she was going to &quot;ruin my credit.&quot;)  Nice, huh&#63; 	1	1	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown

I was there before some people who came in a half hour after me and they took him first and come to find out he was a friend of the dr's.

I feel you have a doctor so at times like this you feel comfortable talking to them.  I did not see the same doctor or nurse twice.  They also do not have radiologists read their ultrasounds.  They take the word of the ultrasound tech who types up the report and is not at all a doctor.  If you are looking for a doctor who is compassionate and helps you through the toughest time, she is not the doctor for you. 	3	3	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown

48	1	I had a bad exp. in the past having 4 wisdom teeth out and since I've been so scared of any dental care which put me in a bad position now. I had a couple of broken teeth that I could no longer deal with the pain and I contacted this Dr. to have them pulled. I was extremely scared and the staff made me feel as comfortable as they could and didn't get fustrated with me. Someone who is as scared as I was can be hard to work with because of the hesitation on everything, but EVERYONE was excellent. Then Dr. Banki came in and actually talked with me getting a complete background of everything to understand a little better why I was there and why I was so scared. I wish he was a dentist so I could get my other teeth fixed but he's only a surgeon. I recommend him to anyone with same issue's I had. My only complaint (sort of) was the TV in Waiting room didn't work - but didn't matter because I wasn't sitting long enough to watch it. Thank you Dr.  B and his office!

This doctor, to hide my what I did not know was to be y last visit, stood in the halway of his office with his arms and legs extened life a basketball player on deense, runing from side to side to physically block my egress  to his nurse to pay the bill for the visit I just had with him.  Two weeks ago, he and hi staff refused to reorder an AFO, a neuro-orthopedic device which must be changed periodically due to muscle atrophy caused by a severed nerve to the tibia muscle.  He abandoned me as a ptient, a cause for disciplinary action by the Medical Board and I am charging him with such this week. A Neurosurgeon wrote a new prescription for me for a AFO.

His office is extremely unprofessional including the receptionist with multiple visible tattoos and piercings and also his young child who is allowed to run wild through the office like it is a day care, not a specialist's office. He is quick to pull you in to his office so he can suck some more money out of you while you are vulnerable for things that could have been advised by phone. Maybe he needs to leech money because he can't keep patients due to his horrible &quot;elite&quot; attitude, fast talking like a hustler and extreme lack of compassion. He is honestly the worst doctor I have seen and I would advise anyone else who is unwell to open the yellow pages and close your eyes and pick a name since you'd probably have better results.

He did this the entire visit. Afterwards,he sent me to the lab in his building for tests my doctor described as &quot;Looking for a lot of purple zebras&quot; ie -- very unlikely, exotic possiblities that I feel were unnecessary for my health concerns, but necessary to pump up his profits on a patient who wasn't going to be regular. During the results, he again spoke extremely fast, pratically pushing me out of his room. I asked if I could call with any follow up questions.

I was chastised for consulting with my regular dentist and asking about surgery. He had the most horrendous bedside manner; the entire visit was about as friendly as a police interrogation. Less than ten minutes in I was told that I would be enduring this pain for the rest of my life, would probably not be able to have a job or attend further schooling, and that neither he nor anyone else could do anything to improve my quality of life. I was seriously considering ending my life as I walked out of the office.

I just want people to know that he makes sure you understand what is wrong with you and exactly what needs to be done to make you well, he also lets you know that he will be there with you until you are completely well.

Was told I needed surgery on my foot and felt as I was being forced into makinig a decision at that moment. He seemed to be annoyed that I wanted time to think about it.

I have had spoken with several other people that have had similar experiences with this doctor and others that have had very bad outcomes if surgery was performed.  	4	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

He left the stitches in another week and when they were removed, I had some bleeding and leakage for several days. I now have trouble walking and am no longer able to run, workout or wear several of my dress shoes. In my opinion, his bedside manner is very poor and he showed no concern for my pain and continued problems. I have since switched surgeons and am going to have corrective surgery for this disaster.

I would recommend her and her and her staff to anyone, they are out standing and worth every penny! I still go there for regular check-ups and I wouldn't have it anyother way!    MY Thanks, to Dr Bilder, for such great work! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
69	1	Dr. Bilder is an example of that rare combination of expert professionalism and personal warmth.  I have been a patient for many years and my experience with Dr. Bilder and her staff has been wonderful.  I recommend her to colleagues, friends and family without hesitation.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Delta Dental
69	-1	Dr. Morton L Perel  Dr. 116 Wayland Avenue Providence, RI 02906 (401) 861-1343 had recommended that I replace an old amalgam filling because it was getting old and replace it with a gold filling. He only recommend I only use a gold filling (cost $1,985)  The gold filling or (Gold Casting) was prepared by Dr. Morton L Perel and the first one was placed by Dr Barbara Bilder.  The gold filling irritated my tongue to the point I had problems speaking.   I had to have the gold filling completely removed from my molar; I choose to use another dentist for this.  I asked in writing three times for my $1,985 back, Dr. Morton L Perel and refused to return my money. I asked for this money back because I have had to spend so far an additional $2,000 on this tooth.  I had work done on another molar with a different dentist Six months later. I had an old filling replaced with white filling it costs me $290 and I had no complications. What a big difference in costs and results. 	3	3	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown
69	1	Dr. Bilder is a brilliant prostodontist, but her fees are through the roof.  She charges three times what any other doctor would. She can also be very condescending to her patients.  I spent over $10,000 having bridge work done on my mouth.  She's good, but I just can't afford her fees.  Also, she didn't do to much for my self esteem. 	4	4	4	4 	Insurance:Unknown
70	1	Dr. Brody really works hard on behalf of his patients.  I had some very complicated health issues and he met with me for nearly two hours on my first visit.  He was thoughtful and attentive and answered all my questions.  I would recommend him without reservation.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
70	1	My family and I have been going to Dr. Brody for about two years and have had good results with homeopathy.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
70	1	Dr Brody was Great. For the first time in medicine I can use the word &quot;feel cured&quot;.  I would recommend him to all.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
70	-1	Ditto to the above comments.  The first thing to look for in a psychoatrist is to see if phone calls are returned 	 11/18/10	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
70	0	This doctor is a homeopath &amp; MD and treats any number of conditions.  I saw him for several years.  He never double books &amp; appointments are on the dot.  He will spend more time with you than any other MD.  He is caring; however he is not always attentive.  He did not have office staff &amp; at times calls can go unreturned for days.  I often had to leave 2 messages over the course of a week to get a call back.   I had one medical problem that was correctly diagnosed but not appropriately treated. As a result it took me far longer to recover from my illness than necessary.  I eventually took my health into my own hands, did the research and realized that I would have to find another doctor.  Lastly He gets defensive when questioned, sometimes forgets to send scripts when he said he would and get defensive about that as well.  I do believe this doctor has a lot of knowledge he just doesn't (seem) to put it to good use all the time (most of the time). 	3	5	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown
71	1	Delivered my first baby via c-section- had such a great experience. She was wonderful! She is very approachable and friendly and I feel like I can ask her anything. Very comfortable even in uncomfortable situations.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Tufts
72	1	My husband and I have seen Dr. Brennan for many years for annual physicals and sick visits.  He is very kind, caring, and takes his time talking with you. I've never felt rushed through an appointment, although sometimes I've had to wait a while to be seen (because he isn't rushing the patients before me). We like his conservative approach to healthcare, in that he doesn't immediately push a pharmaceutical solution to every problem, but discusses the pros and cons of different approaches. He seems very well informed, although we have not experienced any serious medical issues that he needed to address. I would definitely recommend Dr. Brennan.  	4	3	5	4 	Insurance:United Healthcare
73	1	Great with IBD patients.  Dr. Barros and his staff are caring, curious, problem solving in their approach to difficult cases.  Dr. Barros partners and knows each patient as a human.  He and his staff are HUMANE and do their utmost to seek answers and partner other doctors for best patient results.  Great doctor skills, great bedside manner.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

80	-1	He performed surgery on me and I had to go to Boston to get it repaired! I am now permanently disabled and much much worse than I was before the surgery. Thankfully, the damage he caused didn't progress further because I was finally able to find a doctor in Boston to fix the mess Blazar made. I live in severe chronic pain and have no use of one leg because of his surgery. I didn't have these things prior to surgery. I could have lived with his lousy bedside manner and arrogant attitude if he was actually a decent surgeon. He made such a mess of me it took me 9 months to FIND a doctor willing to fix the mess he made. Thanks Blazar, for ruining my life.  	4	2	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
80	1	Dr. Blazer has changed my life. Not once but twice.  He performed a surgery on me a few years ago.  Yes he is confident, and that is what I want in a doctor that is operating on my back.  I Also had severe neck pain and he was kind sympathetic and accurate with his diagnosis.  I went from a person unable to move properly and enjoy my family to a mom that is able to do what I want to do.  Without him I would have a very poor quality of life&#63;  He is a blessing beyond blessings,  I do not hesitate in anyway to recommend dr.  Blazer in anyway! 	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
80	0	Arrogant is not strong enough. Although he has a decent verbal rep for back surgery he is only a number. So are you as he will let you know.He is why orthos get reps for being rude. I do not care about his golf score nor did I like it when he looked at his watch 3 times during the precious 10 minutes I was allowed.There are plentiful good orthos around you do not need his holier than though attitude.Lets face it hes in Attleboro not Wellesley. Oops was that demeaning&#63; 	3	3	1	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
81	1	Dr Bender is one of the kindest people I have been lucky enough to know.  He has been treating my family of 5 for many years.  Dr. Bender is thorough, answers all questions asked and always has a smile on his face.  We recently took in a young lady who has state dental insurance.  I knew something was not right so I went with her to her dentist, he was rude, refused to answer any of my questions.  I had had it.  I took her to  Dr Bender knowing in my heart she would finally get good treatment and she needed someone who cares about people and his work.  Dr Bender has gone above and beyond for her and continues to do so.  Finally we can breath a sigh of relief knowing she will be well cared for.  I would recommend Dr Bender above anyone for dental work.  He in my opinion is the best and I truly from my heart mean that. Thank you Dr Bender for     being the person you are and for your excellent attention to your work.  We could not have asked for more in our dentist and in our friend. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
81	1	i was having a tooth ache and was nervous to begin with. when i was looking around for an office i found dr. benders office  very welcoming and knowledgeable! i would recommened him to anyone! 	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Delta Dental
81	-1	Staff at front desk is not pleasant at all particularly the Amazonian bilingual one.  They very reluctantly took my check, and then must have cashed it IMMEDIATELY after I left.  They obviously did not think it was any good...it was as I'd assured them!  I've never been back since.  I'd been to Dr. Bender's office half a dozen times up to then.  I was also asked to give a photocopy of my driver's license.  I guess they really DID  NOT THINK THET WOULD GET PAID.  I'd written *good* checks as well as paid via credit card in the previous visits.  Dr. Bender seemed adequate and nice enough, but due to above issues I am loathe to recommend his office.  That goes double if the patient, like me, will be self-pay, no insurance at all.  Then they look at and treat you like the dregs of society for not having dental insurance. 	1	5	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
81	-1	Office/Administrative help very inefficient and too quick to get you out the door without making sure they have all the necessary information to complete your paperwork.  The extra time could avoid alot of unecessary delays in payments to both the office and patient.  Hygenist staff very good! 	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

85	1	Dr. Bharier was amazing. I have been seeing doctors for months trying to find out what is wrong with me. Nobody was able or wanting to get to the bottom of all my symptoms. ie. fatigue, numb fingers, gurd, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, muscle weakness and hairloss. Telling me it's age and depression. I am not depressed and I am only 37 and very thin. When my hair started falling out,I asked to see a dermo. One visit and he found out I had Hashimoto's thyroiditis. He called me himself to tell me this. He is very kind and caring and listens to what you have to say. &quot;he is one of the best out there&quot;.And his office has been working with me to get me to the right doctors in a timely manor. He is a top notch doctor and his office personel is awesome. 	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
85	1	Fantastic Doctor!  I was a sun addict in my 20's and am now paying for it with some suspicious moles that have had to be removed.  Dr. Bharier removed a mole from my upper chest about 3 years ago.  I have a tendency to keloid so he injected it with a little cortisone and there is just the slightest, barely noticable mark (which he fully warned me would happen).  I suffer from anxiety and tend to ask a lot of questions.  Dr Bharier always makes me feel at ease and I never feel rushed.  	3	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

85	1	I have Dr. Bharier over the years, yes you want but not because he overbooks, it is because he takes his time with the patients.  If you have questions, he is all ears.  Way is everyone in a rush to go no where.  Not many doctors, bankers, grogery stores that you do not wait for.  Take a book and have some quiet time! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

85	-1	You can always expect to see Dr. Bharier at least 1 hour after your scheduled appointment. He always over books his schedule. The last visit I had to wait almost 3 months to see him, waited 1 hour in the waiting room prior to him seeing me and all he did was tell me that I needed to see an aesthetician for what I was looking for. It was clearly documented why I was there, and he felt the need to charge for the visit when he did absolutely nothing, and knew prior to the visit that there was nothing he could do.  	1	1	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

87	-1	Perhaps it's unfair to rate an MD based on his office staff, but it's his fault for hiring the bottom of the barrel. I called this doctor’s office to make an appointment and was told they do not make appointments for new patients over the phone-- that I MUST come in and fill out paperwork (most MD's will fax or mail you&#63;). The office staff was too busy chatting with another patient about a girl who used to work in the office to even notice I was standing waiting. I filled out my paperwork and then told I had to wait AGAIN. I took time off work to sit and fill out paperwork so simply asked if I could call or if they could call me--Got a rude response and a dirty look. I asked for my paperwork and thanked them for a waste of time--The girl responded No problem, my pleasure&quot; If this is how his staff is...I can imagine what the doctor is like. Office is dank and dirty looking.  I wasted 20 minutes just trying to make an appointment in person--- I would rather be seen and treated by a Vet! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

90	-1	While Dr. Buster was friendly, here were my issues.  When husband visited and asked questions, Dr. Buster would only look at me and answer to me.  My husband did not feel included.  Additionally, I asked if all hormone tests had been completed in my bloodwork, and he answered a blanket &quot;yes&quot;, without showing me what was done, why, and what the results were.  After 2 failed IUIs and 1 failed IVF, he said I was in the 10% they call &quot;unexplained infertility&quot;.  This was not an answer, so I left and went to a new doctor (never received a follow-up call from Buster's office) and the new doctor found high prolactin levels and that I shared a gene with my husband.  She corrected both with a pill and blood thinners and on 2nd IUI with her, we got pregnant with twins.  I feel Dr. Buster did not investigate all routes and went the easy way (infertility procedures) which cost us tens of thousands of dollars.  There were also duplicate tests run too many times. 	3	4	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown

93	1	DR B's nurse is horrific,she is rude and short tempered, not pleasant at all, and does not explain anything, she needs to be replaced, he will lose patients due to her. The secretary also can be snappy and rude, it would be nice if she were to have a pleasant Personality. DR B is convenient location wise.sometimes he is a bit dismissive when you ask him questions.He is ok, not the best not the worst. His staff however truly need to work on their professionalism when dealing with patients. Sometimes you feel more like you are an object on an assembly line.  	2	3	4	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
93	0	His staff was cold and indifferent.  I got appointments readily because I pushed.  They did not like my knowledge of historical chronic disease and dismissed what I knew was wrong.  It is my fault I was inarticulate and upset at the number of medical crisis that I was facing - but I was made to feel small and problematic when I was in most need of investigative thinking and case managing.  I had not realized he was new to practicing when I came to him in 2007.  My level of issues at the time were complicated by auto immune domino effects.  I felt he was dismissive and my needs were like too much hard work. After leaving his care for another PCP, we detected a multiple layer of issues that answered the continued unanswered questions that were building to crisis surgery shortly after Dr. B &amp; I mutually fired each other. I also did not realize his limited days of work availability at that time.  Perhaps all this has cleared up and he has built a better practice.   We did not get along! 	1	3	3	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	-1	Dr. Bandola is very bias, putting his personal feelings in front of medical perspectives, hypothesises and facts. He looks for simple answers to mask real and serious problems. However if you have a problem, despite if it gets resolved or not the office will usually take you in within that week. However one would usually rather wait an extra week to have the problem solved by a doctor that cared and whom you have a good relationship with.  	3	5	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

I WOULD NOT recommend this doctor even to your household pet. Look around and make sure you are positive on who you want as a family/general doctor. General Doctors are the most important, why settle with someone who doesn't take their position seriously.. when it can seriously effect your or your childrens life.. People are counting on you!
