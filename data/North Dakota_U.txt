1	1	Very kind and patient with me and answered all my questions.  Went with the least invasive surgery first and then reviewed results before going to next step.   I would (and have) definitely recommended him!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
1	1	He performed bunion surgery on July 8, 2009. On July 18, 2009, I rode 45 miles on my bicycle, pain free. I was back to work 5 days after the surgery and completely ambulatory. I had several appointments with him prior to the surgery and he was extremely helpful in explaining the condition and taking the appropriate steps before deciding on the ultimate step of surgery. I would go back to him if I needed further care and I'd recommend him to anyone I cared about. My entire experience was positive with both Dr. Uglem and the MeritCare institution.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
1	-1	Had seen Dr. Uglem over a period of a couple of years. Have very serious foot condition and finally asked for a referral for a second opinion. I believe a good doctor would agree that with such a serious condiotion that I should have a second opinion. Since asking for that second opinion he does not give care and concern as he has over the years. I believe it is poor judgement to chastize a patient for a second opinion. I am very disappointed because before this issue, I really liked him as my Doctor.  		2	2	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
1	-1	Went to him with chronic leg pain + had bad experiences. He didn't seem like he knew what he was doing and he only had the most expensive treatments in mind... and tried only those! He didn't listen to me much either. Had lots of appts. but little success... finally stopped going! 		3	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
