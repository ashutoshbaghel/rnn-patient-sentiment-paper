3	1	 Nick is flat-out superb. Personable, courteous, unhurried, knowledgeable, and just plain likes people, as well as being a good doc. In-hospital or out, he takes time to listen and explain, both to patients and families. Gives patients his cell phone number, and he personally answers it! When there's a bump (and they do happen), takes responsibility and fixes it. Clearly well trained with good mature judgment; a physician in and of the old school. Very highly recommended.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:United Healthcare
