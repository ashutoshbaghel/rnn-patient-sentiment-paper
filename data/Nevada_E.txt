9	1	commentsdr ellero was my anesthesiologist during a long and serious operation to remove my infected and enlarged prostate gland. the surgery lasted 4 hours, 2 hours more than usual for this procedure. i believe she may have saved my life because of the trauma to my body during the operation and the excessively long recovery. i of course don't know the details of what occurred because of my unconscious state. nevertheless, i suspect her excellent decisions were paramount to my recovery. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

13	-1	commentsDr. Ender is the rudest doctor I have ever met. He would only accept cash, which I went to the bank and withdrew. He was so rude to my fianc√©e that he had her in tears just before a major surgery. After we complained to the surgeon, he returned the cash I had paid him and stormed out of the building like a spoiled child, causing us to have to reschedule the surgery. After a negative review, he threatened us with a lawyer through the surgeon. He didn't even contact us himself.  Shame on Dr. Ender!  This is only my opinion and I'm not telling anyone not to use him. I'm sure he is very capable, but I feel that the rudeness, lack of respect, and unprofessional behavior is completely unacceptable!  My family will not be using his services, EVER!!!  I never met his staff, only him. Don't know how knowledgable he is since he refused to do his job. He was on time though. I never went to his office. 	3	5	1	3	Insurance:Unknown

If anyone asked how much longer t would be the staff would snap at us and say we just had to be patient it would only be a couple of minutes. When I met with Dr. EL Eid she was the most inconsiderate one of the all. She was short with me as if I inconvenienced her by even going. She implied that my doctor had wasted her time by referring me. She was cold, uncaring, and conceited. I am currently trying to find another doctor. 		1	2	1	Insurance:Unknown

I highly recommend Dr. Earl.  Carolina Liao 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unicare
21	1	 Dr. Earl has been my dentist since I was a child.  In all those years of fillings and cleanings I have not felt one ounce of pain from a shot or a drill.

21	-1	commentsMaybe I have been spoiled by my previous dentist, but I was greatly disappointed with my experiences with Dr. Earl and his staff.  I recently moved here and Dr. Earl was recommended to me by a co-worker.  The hygienist was the only person that I felt to be personable and competent.  I waited over 30 minutes past my appointment time to even be taken back.  No one told me what was going on with my own mouth and the plan they had for my treatment.  Dr. Earl and his staff need to do better at communicating with their patients--the status of the patient's teeth, their plan of action for any problem areas, and the scheduling of appointments.  They assumed I knew what was going on and/or that I would do exactly what they wanted me to do when they wanted me to do it.  There were also billing issues that seemed to have been a result of incompetence on the part of one of his staff members.  I will not be returning and would recommend that you shop around for a caring dentist and staff. 	2	2	1	3	Insurance:Unknown
21	1	commentsWhat a great dentist! We moved here not long ago, and I wondered if i would ever find one I liked as much as my old one. He patiently helped me to understand all my dental issues, and answered all of my questions and concerns so well. I was more than impressed with his work too. I get so many compliments on my smile, I feel 10 years younger. The improvements in my smile were better than plastic surgery I could have gotten for my overall appearance!

40	-1	 I had a brow and eyelift.  Dr Eggert left horrible very noticeable zigzag scars on my forehead.  During the consult she told me that the doctors who use the scalp method were old fashioned and stupidly I believed her.  I have thick scars as well on the scalp itself.   She cut too far out on the lid on one eye and not enough on the other eye.  As time goes by there is a noticeable shape and size difference between my eyes.   But worst of all she pulled the trigeminal nerves too tight and I will have to be on medication for the rest of my left or feel significant pain.   Least of all, I suppose, is that the crown of my head is permanently numb.   I consulted with a neurologist who doubts that the feeling will ever come back.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:United Healthcare

She came to the waiting room to tell my friend she had some differculty with one eye. She told me &quot;she is not God&quot;I feel like I have sand in my eye. The optomologist I went to told me my eyes do not close all the way. One eye lid is lower then the other.Luckily I can still see.

After the second, not only did I have symmastia, but I had also bottomed out and I had several hard knots under my skin that you could even see! I am an out of state patient and Dr.E always took the time to answer my questions via email. After discussing his plan for my procedure he promised that he would operate until he had acheived the very best result that he could for me. My breasts look great, the repair feels sturdier, you cannot see or feel any of my internal sutures (even though he uses 4 rows for support!! --he can suture, that's a fact!)

The nurses (especially Jackie) was so personable and excellent in every way. I must have called the office 1000 times and they answered my questions with diligence and professionalism each time. The most important thing -  I was referred to 6 different surgeons from girlfriends, and I consulted with Dr. Edwards last. I had NEVER seen his work in person, or knew of anyone who went to him. I chose Dr. Edwards simply by &quot;gut-feeling&quot; and internet research. This doctor knows what he's talking about! The moment I met him, I knew right then and there I was going to choose him.

48	1	commentsDr. Earl of the Mayo Clinic is extremely knowledgeable in the area of breast reconstruction after breast cancer. He will discern what needs to be done while making you feel that you are still a women (or a man in some cases). I highly recommend Dr. Earl and the Mayo Clinic for any person needing reconstructive surgery after breast cancer. There should be more surgeons and clinics aspiring to treat patients in this way.

53	-1	commentsMake sure they get authorization from your insurance company before having a procedure done. Other wise you may end up paying full price because they already preformed the procedure without having authorization from your insurance. This happened to me. 3 weeks later the office manager informed me I owed $350 because the insurance wouldn't cover a deep cleaning. Because I felt that they didn't do their job properly and was taken advantage of, I decided I wasn't responsible for their mistake.The office manager said it wasn't their problem, I signed for the procedure so I was totally responsible. Instead of taking any type of responsibility for the situation, they sent me to a collection agency. I have no recourse now put to pay. But I believe under the circumstances they could have taken some responsibility and at least offered to pay part of the bill. Make sure you get authorization from the insurance first. Do not trust that they will do it for you. I will never go back there. 	2	2	2	2	Insurance:Unknown

53	-1	 I went to this dentist to have 4 teeth pulled, 1 cut out and have one filling put in.  When I left his office I had 4 fillings and was told if I feel pain to give him a call and then he would prescribe some pain medicine.  The very next day I felt extreme pain.  I called Dr. Eberle's office and was told that I would have to call a different office because the dentist went on vacation.  I called the other office (on a Friday) and they said they could not see me that day to call back tomorrow (Monday).  When I did call back I was informed Eberle was back from vacation to call him.  I did and was told I owed them money so they could not see me.  That was 4 years ago and I am still suffering from the pain of his mistakes.  The teeth he filled were not even worth the filling.  He also left a nerve exposed which was the source of the pain immediately following my appointment with him.  I was also told my insurance was maxed out but it was not.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:AnthemPaid/Co-pay:$250

He ignored the fact a med I was taking had a side effect he interpreted as a blood clot in each leg simultaneiously. According to the FDA, this drugs caused ankle edema. I took a blood test for allegies and for cholesterol. He never went over those results. He walks out of the room and you have no idea he's not coming back. I had to tell his assistant to get him so I'd know what was wrong with me as he never told me.

His been with my family for the longest time, delivered me from my mother. I'm twenty years old and have been seeing him. The office knows me well, every time I go in they ask how my boyfriend and family is doing. Dr Edwards is a gentlemen, he always comes in shakes your hand and asks how you are. He's very gentle, and makes sure your comfortable. He always lends a hand to help me off the chair. He's just great, I have never felt more comfortable with another doctor. My insurance got messed up once, and they let me have my check up for free. I moved to Texas with my boyfriend, and he sends my birth control prescription to me out there. As well, when we had std's come up he offered to send medicine to both me and my boyfriend in Texas if we didn't come cleared. He tries his best to work with you. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

OB/Gyn's are not paid by the number of visits you receive when you are under the care for a pregnancy, so multiple visits over the necessary 13 are at cost to the clinic.  Dr. Edwards sees patients as needed to maintain their health and well being.  He is one of the most caring individuals I had the pleasure to observe over the course of my training, and is an excellent teacher.  As for timeliness, I don't think he has that, but it's because he cares and listens.  I spent time with him in surgery, and will say that I wish he could be my physician, but we have moved states.  He is on the ball, and I've been around the block when it comes to seeing docs and how they practice. 	5	3	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
79	-1	commentsAt first I thought i'd give the office a chance, the receptionist was always friendly and helpful. His students were as well, but as for him and his nurse they were not. I had to ask the nurse a couple times to use gloves when taking blood. Dr. Edwards never really gave useful or relevant information to me about my condition or anything really. Inconveniently scheduled every 2 weeks through entire 2nd trimester, usually for staff to take my blood pressure and say hi. I would say that was to get as many co-pays out of me as possible. Never really did anything medical. Any tests performed I had to ASK what my results were, they were never given to me up front the next visit. Felt like a help yourself kind of place. Bathroom has graffiti and obsceneties on the walls. Office doesn't seem overall clean. Not a good feeling until you walk out the door. The only person I liked was the receptionist. I had to ask myself if I trusted this doctor to deliver my baby and landed on no. Poor practice. 	2	2	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
79	-1	 when I had a miscarraige i was treated horribly they assumed i had a d&c; since i passed some tissue at the emergency room also was told if i wanted him to look over my paper work from it i had to go get it. Thats not all when i got pregnant two months after and asked for a beta level check or an ultrasound to make sure the baby was ok i was cornered in a tiny room by the nurse while he yelled at me telling me that getting either of those test done wont stop me from having a miscarriage and when i tried to explain it was to ease my worrying he said i would get my first ultrasound at 20 weeks i never went back after that and found a new dr.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
79	1	 Dr. Edwards is very profressional and compassionate doctor. He is very informative providing diagrams along with explaining things in simple terms that anyone would understand. He performed a Cone Biopsy at Sunerise Hospital where the staff was very professional and compassionate.  	4	5	5	4	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal

92	1	commentsI was very satisfied when Dr. Michael Alkanich did my lumbar reconstruction procedure. He was down to earth cared for me and answered all my inquiries before my sugery, and everything he told me is right. I'm doing well now, and everything goes well with my reconstruction surgery. It's been 1 yr. and 6 months now....I'm happy and I will recommend Dr. Elkanich is the best doctor ever. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

92	-1	 I had a horriable experience!!  The office staff is rude and the X-Ray tech. was pushing my body into the wall and angles that I could not do because of pain.  She didn't care kept pushing on it anyways.   The doctor never introduced himself, he is just very cold!  I would not recommend him nor his office to anyone!!! 	1	4	1	1	Insurance:Workers Comp
92	1	commentsThe surgeon has extremely helpful staff who do all they can to make the patient comfortable.  The office does run behind as most medical offices do, however the care that is given reminds you that if you were in real trouble, that extra care would also be given to you.  I don't know about you, but I have no problem waiting under these circumstances.  Dr. ElKanich is warm, genuine and honestly cares for his patients.  He knowledge is unsurpassed and his thoroughness shows that he not only enjoys his work,  but wants to do the best for his patients.  I want to thank all in this office for making this a memorable time and for making me feel that you honestly care about ME. 	5	4	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

99	-1	 was in two different ERs 3 times in a month for chronic condition. ended up with Dr. Edson twice. He was rude, condescending, and is negligent to the point of being dangerous to his patients. Came in complaining of seizures, he attempted to treat me for vaginal bleeding. Stopped him in time. Then administered pain meds against my wishes - had no pain! Meds made me worse - couldn't walk to bathroom, was vomiting. Ordered CT only after I asked, then went home without ever getting results. Left nurse orders to discharge me. Had to ask several times for test results - turns out I had a mass in my brain. On second run in, suggested I was lying about seizures even though they were witnessed by radiologists. Kept me in a bed with NO IV, unchecked for nearly 12 hours. His actions are dangerous. Two different nurses even told me to disregard him, and get to another doctor quick. If you see him, run.  		1	1	1	Insurance:Anthem

100	-1	 I met Dr. Eells after my physician moved to another state and he took over my case.  After our first meeting, Dr. Eells stated that he wanted to discontinue all my pain medication despite the fact that I am disabled with Rheumatoid Arthritis (98%) and also have CMT-type 2 (Charcot-Marie-Tooth).  I told him he was insane!  I have severe pain on a daily basis and this doctor wanted to take me off of all pain meds!  I asked him if he had taken the time to read my file because it seemed that he did not.  Bottom line:  I never went back to see this doctor and would never recommend him to anyone.  After some time, I received a call from his office, apologizing and wanting me to come back.  I declined.  	3	5	1	1	Insurance:United Healthcare
100	1	commentsMy husband &amp; I have been going to Dr. Eells for years.  He is a very compassionate &amp; caring man who listens to you.  He runs his practice with a proactive instead of a reactive mindset.  Also, if we are sick, we can get an appointment within 24 hours, not a week or two.  My husband would only go to a doctor if he was deathly sick before meeting Dr. Eells.  Now he goes for his physicals all the time.  Laura M. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
