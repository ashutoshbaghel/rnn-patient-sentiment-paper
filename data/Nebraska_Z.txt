4	-1	 seen for many years, he changed over the years , now send you through in 5 min with him, after wait 3 hours.  he never has looked at my feet an i am diabetic for over 10 years.  I think its time to find a new doctor.  plan on waiting 3- to 3 hours  15 other people have the same time as you.  Rude man dont expect kindess, he says what he feels is appropriate.  	2	1	2	2	Insurance:MedicarePaid/Co-pay:N/A
4	1	 Doctor Z is the best. He's been my family doctor for years. I wouldn't go to anybody else.  except for his PA Jill 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:CIGNAPaid/Co-pay:N/A
4	-1	 Sometimes the Dr. makes odd comments. A family member that sees him said he hurts his feelings by making fun of him and calling him names. (Makes fun of his weight). Who needs that from your DR.&#63; I prefer the P.A.  Jill Phelps 	3	2	1	2	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
6	-1	commentsThis dentist worked on me when I was 11.  It was bad enough that he filled 15 teeth in one visit.  But when I began to choke (because I was all numbed up, incl. my throat muscles), he panicked and ran out of the room, leaving his assistant to deal with the problem.  I'm amazed this guy is still in business. 	3	3	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
6	1	commentsHe is the most caring and helpful dentist I have ever been to. His work is excellent and I wouldn't ever go elsewhere. 		5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	 He repeatedly ignored my husband's complaints of tooth pain during three back to back appointments. Doctor missed a cracked tooth that required a root canal. This was after 3 weeks of severe pain, swelling, & emotional distress.  Needless to say we have left his practice! 		3	1	2	Insurance:Delta DentalPaid/Co-pay:N/A
18	-1	 I saw Dr. Zaruba in the Humphrey clinic and was dismayed that he was on his cell phone much of the time.  It was obvious to me that he was planning out the remainder of his day off which must have started after he was done with me and my child.  Definite loss of style points dude.  Put the cell phone away when you are on my time. :(  It causes me to feel that you are not focused on me.  	4	3	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

24	1	 Dr. Zink has been a very caring doctor medically and in the examining office. Sometimes she is behind on appointments because of it. However, when I had an insurance problem she was a little less caring.  		4	5	5	Insurance:AnthemPaid/Co-pay:N/A
24	1	 Dr. Zink is the best in her profession. After many years as my doctor, I feel confident in her advice and practice. I wish she could clone her medical knowledge, experience, and bedside manner.  		5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

41	1	commentsThe initial visit was $350 and then $45 if adjustment needed &amp; $30 if not. I was paying a $30 copay 2-3 times a week for my last chiro. Once I was adjusted by Dr. Ziska....What can I say but THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! Well worth the 2 hour drive for me. 	5	3	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

58	1	 This doctor's surgery looks like it is from another time era, however look past that and you will find a very knowledgeable and kind doctor. Me personally I am not about a doctors bedside manner so to speak, I am more concerned if they know their job. Dr Zieno however treats you with kindness and listens carefully to all of your ailments. I may never get to see him on time but that is because he spents too much time listening to his patients, that to me is acceptable. I would rather he keep me waiting for that then rushing me through his office and not listen to a word I say.  	5	4	5	5	Insurance:TricarePaid/Co-pay:N/A
