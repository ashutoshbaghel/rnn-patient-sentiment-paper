1	1	Was my daughter's doctor from childhood through college. EXCELLENT in all respects. Gets to know the patient and child. Makes personal phone calls, is open to new ideas..is constantly learning. Love Dr. Quayle. ! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
1	-1	My son has been in a lot since birth, and every time we are told something different. None of their suggestions work, and no follow up is ever provided. Most recently was told to switch to formula (we breastfeed exclusively) rather than actually addressing the problem at hand, which was not related to feeding at all. Were also pressured about vaccinations when we made it clear we wanted to delay vaccinating. In addition, we brought son in with an infection and were sent home. We ended up in the ER less than a day later.  My son has a unisex name, and the nurses and doctors ask every time how &quot;she&quot; is, even after we explained that we have a baby boy (and even when he is wearing blue)! 	2	1	1	1 	Insurance:CIGNA
