2	1	I like Dr.Alka Aggawal but have many issues recently. When I  try to get my scrips filled the reception sends them over when she feels the need to not when shes asked to. I can go day or so without my daily needed meds cause of this. No matter how many times you call gets you no where. I was in the hospital and instead of Dr.Aggwal coming in. She sent a lady who I never have meet before, it wasn't the best time to send someone that your patient had never meet. The worst part was this lady was no help. I like my family doctor but im thinking its time to get a new doctor.  	2	4	3	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
2	1	Nice office staff. Nurse Mary is a wonderful nurse and caring health care worker. I can't say enough about how wonderful Mary is. She is sent from heaven. Dr. Aggarwal takes her time with her patients. She has been my Dr. for over 20 years and I will keep her.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
2	-1	I have gone to her for a few years for my annual PAP's and was always very pleased with the overall service and friendliness of her and the staff. But the last time I went, the results came back abnormal. She had her staff call me and tell me I had to see a specialist, but no one would tell me anything else, and she wouldn't talk to me. I was obviously scared, and had to wait 2 weeks to see a specialist, just for them to read me my results and tell me they found precancerous cells. When scheduling for a follow-up, even the specialist said to schedule with them since Agarwal pawned me off to them with the first sign of trouble. For this reason, I will not go back to this Dr. When the results are abnormal, instead of talking to you or giving you any information at all, she'd rather just brush you off to a specialist. I will not come back to this Dr, and I will not recommend her for this reason alone. 	5	1	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown

3	-1	My husband and I both saw &quot;Dr. John&quot; and both had awful experiences!  We had to pay another dentist to fix the terrible job he did on my husband's crown.   DO NOT go to this dentist! 	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
3	-1	When I went to this dentists' office, my son saw him and I saw a female dentist that went by &quot;Dr. Amy&quot;.  I do know that was her first name, I'm not sure of her last name though.  I have had A LOT of dental work done in my life; braces, spacers, jaw too small etc.  NEVER have I experienced the PAIN that I did with that girl TRYING to numb me up for a simple filling.  I'm only slightly exaggerating when I say my whole head was numb, but I still was in horrible pain when she started to drill. She gave me so many shots, my face was puffed up from the fluid, I could not feel my tongue.  I felt like I had a stroke.  When I jerked from the pain of the drill, she asked if I wanted another shot... I said &quot;NO&quot;!  Then I asked my son how his visit went and his reply was &quot;you mean with Dr. pain&#63;&quot;  My son has always had a pretty high tolerance to pain if that tells you anything.  Long story short...DO NOT GO TO THIS DENTIST! Unless you like pain.  	2	5	2	2 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal

5	0	No staff were present.... Note on window said something to the effect of... Receptionist is out of the office....Have a seat and the doctor will be with you shortly. Appointment time was punctual.  Appeared to be kind, intelligent and interested to hear details. He was comfortable to talk to and did not make you feel too uncomfortable. No doctor/patient relationship was established. 	1	5	1	5 	Insurance:Unknown
5	-1	This man did not give a true report.  His report did not reflect the actual conversation that he and I had!!!! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
5	-1	This man is not a good dr. He does not listen to what you say and tries to help .  Instead he twists words and misdiagnosis which is very dangerous. If you need help, he is so bad he will try to make you look like an idiot and NOT help you with a problem. I think he probably sold his soul to the devil along time ago and his motivator is money not the patient. If you are looking for a good doctor there are plenty of other doctors with integrity that can help you. Don,t waste your time and money on this nut ball. 	2	2	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

5	-1	Dr Ager is a hired gun.  Workers comp sent me to him and I see why.  They know to secure a denial, call Dr Ager.  He makes money in an unconscionable way.  He told flat out lies in my report or was just not listening well because his facts were way off.  He drew conclusions that had no link to truth told.  He certainly said one thing in the office and wrote a completely scathing report of the opposite.  It was clear to me that workets comp pays him to deny claims and he gladly accepts the money and has no concern for his clients and the help they may need.  I can honestly say he took things out of context and linked them to false conclusions.  He also contradicted himself several times in his report.  The man appears to have no regard for the truth and no desire to be fair.  He is out to stamp the red DENIED stamp and cash his check.  A state board should look into the percentage of cases he denies, it has to be in the high 90's.  Prepare for an appeal if you see him.  	1	2	1	1 	Insurance:Workers Comp

Flipped my semi-truck on purpose because I knew the company was changing hands.. ROFLMAO yeh right...  The list goes on..  His office is a joke, papers everywhere stacked over 2 feet high on every surface.  It's not a wonder he was so wrong he is so unorganized.  I knew this was going to be a farce from the start.  I believe he is 100% in it for comp with no concerns for the injured.  He called my husband an unsophisticated man.. Boy if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black.  He needs a haircut and a maid, office staff that actually open the glass to speak with you would be a nice touch too.  My one thought is that God will punish him in the end.  I don't wish it, but may he have a significant other with an injury and watch them go from being one person to another after an accident.  SHAME SHAME SHAME! 	1	5	1	1 	Insurance:Workers Comp

6	-1	The whole point of making an appointment is to keep a schedule.  Its also important to let the people in the waiting room know if you are behind and would they like to re schedule at a later date.   Keep in mind that the patients time is just as important to them as the dentists time is important him or her. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	1	Dr. Abate is a wonderfull and caring doctor.  I trust her options and treatment completely.  I would never see anyone else.  Sometimes there is a wait to see her, but there is a wait every where.  The staff is friendly and accomidating with my children.  I wouldn't go any where else.  Overall the best part of Dr. Abate is she is the most gentle dentist i have ever used, and she goes out of her way to make sure that i am comfortable at my appointment. 	 3/4/10	5	3	5	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	Be prepared to wait!  Waiting in the lobby and waiting in the dentist chair.  No matter what time I go, even when there are no other patients, it is always a 30 minute wait... at the minimum.  The hygienist is very gentle, but that is the only good thing about this practice!  I needed a bridge, and it took FIVE MONTHS of wasted visits and time to get it to the right fit and was the right color.  They over-billed my insurance company on every visit and ended up giving me the extra money as a &quot;refund&quot; for the hassle.  Now I've switched to a different office altogether, and it turns out that a crown they put on a molar for a &quot;fractured tooth&quot; wasn't even the right tooth!  It still hurts because it wasn't the correct tooth that they &quot;fixed&quot;.  What a waste of money and time. 	1	1	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	Went in for a routine cleaning and after the the cleaning was finished I was told she left and they sent in in another dentist to do my check up. Thew called him Dr. Jay.  He told me a front tooth that was crowned had receeded and he could bond this.  I said ok.  Three days later I woke up up with a severe tooth ach.  I was told I needed a root canal on a tooth by Dr Abate that was perfectly healthy before they tampered with it.  After 2 attempts Dr Abate could not perform the root canal and sent me to an endodontist.  Three days after I went back for a follow up and she told me the tooth next to it needed a root canal.  To make a very long story short that tooth had already had a root canal that I could have seen if she would have shown me the x-ray.  This was confirmed by the endodontist and my new dentist.  They both stated there was nothing wrong with the tooth.  That was 6 months ago and the tooth is fine.  Dr. Abate and her partner should not be able to practice denistry. 	1	1	3	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	I went to Dr Abate when she worked with another dentist, Dr. Delaura.. After breaking off a tooth when taking impressions, I had to have the tooth pulled. Put on a bridge that never fit properly. Then got a terrible infection in the gum where the tooth was pulled.  After a few months Dr. Delaura called me and said he had to check all her work.  He took x-rays and found that she left a piece of the root in my gum.  He had already &quot;let her go&quot;.  So I had to have the bridge removed, surgery to remove the piece or root, a new bridge made, AGAIN!!! Would never , ever, recommend this dentist to anyone. I went through a year of hell because of this woman.  Thank god Dr. Delaura repaired all the work she had done.  Please don't use this dentist!!!! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	First time I went to this dentist, I waited 1/2 an hour in the waiting room and another 1/2 an hour in the chair(cleaning & routine check-up). Staff was quite rude and not knowledgable. I went in for the second time to get fillings and was given anestetic that knocked me out. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move, talk, and had crazy palpitations. Both dentist and her staff left me alone for 20 minutes to attend to other patients. I thought I will suffocate and die on that dentist chair, as I couldn't call anybody or get up to move to look for help. Appears I was alergic to the anesthetic they gave me. When they finally came back found me half awake, they gave me oxygen to stabilize me and told me I had bad reaction to the anesthetic! I left the office dismayed and before I got to my car, half of the filling fell out. Be very affraid of this dentist. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	Since having my wisdom teeth removed, I can no longer feel the left side of my face. I went in to have fillings filled and this was the end result. I trusted she knew what she was doing. I know there has to be someone to look into this situation for this dental office. Since MY visit to this office I've learned she has opened up a Spa in the office and is now doing botox and collogen too.  	 4/22/08	2	2	2	Insurance:Delta Dental
6	-1	My dental work was very routine—just 2 crowns--but this dentist has chosen a poor lab, and her technique is unacceptable. After several (5 or 6) appointments, I still do not have a permanent crown on one molar, and the temporary ones she has installed fall out after 2 - 3 days. The other permanent crown, in front, fell out 2 times until another dentist installed it correctly. She did refund my money and told me she would completely understand if I sought another dentist to do the work; however, this does not repay the time I've taken from work, the discomfort, the embarrassment of having a tooth missing, and the fact that it will be another 2 - 3 weeks before I can have another crown made by someone else. Finally, she insisted on enforcing &quot;office policy&quot; and charging me to have my dental records reproduced for a new dentist, even though she says she understands why I will go elsewhere. Since she owns the practice, I found that to be ridiculous.  		5	1	1 	Insurance:Delta Dental

8	1	Dr. Agosta is truly a blessing. I have been a patient for seven years and choosing him is one of the best decisions that I ever made. He is brilliant. He handled both of my pregnancies...problems and all. He did one of my two c sections and has handled my other female issues. Dr. Agosta is a truly compassionate doctor that truly cares for his patients. He has been monitoring a lump in my breast and has been very concerned... more so than the surgeon that is monitoring the situation. He always takes the time to talk to me and make me comfortable with not only my gynological issues but with my injuries from my auto accident. I would reccomend Dr. Agosta to any woman looking for an amazing, caring doctor.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare

9	1	My husband was referred to Dr. Aggarwal for retinal bleeding. He explained all of the procedure to me and even showed the photos of the eye to me and explained what I was seeing; being a retired RN, I knew a small amount of informtion and was very comfortable asking him questions, which he answered in a very professional way. So far, I would recommend him to anyone with a retinal problem. He is very distinguished and speaks with an accent, which I have always found to be helpful for a Doctor. I listen more carefully and am able to understand so that I can ask questions, if necessary in an intelligent way. His nurse was super in answering any questions that I had.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
9	-1	He acted angry from the first second entering the room.

16	1	Dr Abuzeid, is an very knowledgable and excellent doctor. We we given our options and decided on IVF. We have him to thank for our twins. iVF worked on the first try. The medications was very expensive, which cost as much as the procedure itself. Dr  Abuzeid initially told us three embryos would be implanted but during the procedure after he implanted the first embryo he asked if we would like another one implanted and we agreed to have another two implanted but the Dr said he would only implant one aditional embryo. Thankfully he made the right decision because the two embryos took and she  became pregnant wth twins. After my wife became pregnant the Nurses were cold and rude when we had questions or concerns.  They got the statistic they wanted. We felt like we were just a statistic to them. The twins were born, the staff called asking for information. I declined because of how we were treated. Still I recommend Dr Abuzeid  100% because he did what we paid him to do. 	 2/12/12	1	3	5	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	Best fertility doctor in michigan! When other doctors told me it was not possible to get pregnant he mafe it possible. I am now pregnant with twins. This man never ever gives up.

16	1	Wonderful doctor and wonderful staff.  IVF is difficult emotionally and you are dealing with hormonally imbalanced women as it is.  This is a science and not a nursery, so women stop being so unbalanced about your review and stick with the logistics.  If IVF gives you the highest percentage of having a child then do not question the Dr. that has seen more positive results than you have.  He, like many, did not go to school for free, so stop ****ing, pay the $ or start praying for a child more.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

I was devastated and will not go back there! 	2	2	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	I have nothing bad to say about Dr Abuzeid. He is always very patient and willing to answer all our questions. I ended up having surgery for a genetic defect but never felt like he was pressuring us to have surgery. I was equally impressed with the nurses. The only negative experience we had was with an office person and that only happened once. Sometimes we had to wait a while to be seen and they do have to look at your chart to refresh their memories about what is going on with you, but they are busy because they are good! I would rather they check my chart than try to go off memory and get something wrong.  Overall I think Dr Abuzeid is fantastic! 	3	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

16	1	I went through 3 IVF cycles with Dr. Abuzeid and had 2 boys.  I have the most respect for him and his staff.  For my second procedure I didn't want a phone call to tell me if I was pregnant.  I told his staff that I would come in for the results.  When my husband and I arrived we were taken to a room and when the door was opened the whole staff was inside yelling congratulations.  Dr. Abuzeid doesn't force any procedure on you. He is a great listener and has great knowledge.  He was once rated as one of the top 10 infertilist in the nation. That says a lot.  I have many friends that have used his serves and not one of them has a bad thing to say about him or his staff.  One of my friends had a procedure used that he himself helped developed.  They now have 3 children from his help.  After both of our sons were born my husband and I went to get pictures with Dr. Abuzeid and his staff.  I can't tell you how many times he kissed our children.   He is definitely in it for the children!!!! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

16	1	I love this doctor and his staff!! They are the best. I am young only 20 and have endometriosis. This is my second Dr. that I have seen for this. My other Dr was rude and was offended when I brought in my own research that I did. Dr. Abuzeid, loved that I looked things up on my own and did some of his ow research. I wanted a surgery (excision of the endo) that he does not perform. He referred me to an out of state Dr. even wrote a letter and made a phone call to the Dr. personally. Not many Dr.'s would do that especially if they aren't doing the surgery. I am very thankful that I  found IVF and Dr. Abuzeid. He explains things clearly and is always open to questions. He always takes your opinion into consideration. He backs everything up with science too, not just by saying I have done this before. He really gets to know you also. I would recommend him to anyone.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	1	All business, and it shows in his results.  We had been working with another specialist who was way to old school, kept telling us to be patient, don't put too much pressure on yourselves, all the stuff you don't want to hear when you are trying to have a family.  Dr. Abuzeid said if you want kids we'll make it happen.  We listened, followed his direction, and now I'm the proud father of twin girls.  If you want results, this is the office.  If you want to take your time, drag your feet, and talk the issue to death move on.  Dr. Abuzeid is passionate about working with people who want kids.  His office is good at what they do and they want to help as many families as the can.  As for the office caring too much about the stats, thank goodness they matter to him; because they matter to the couples that have been trying to have kids for month/years.  We have since referred three couples to the office all of which are now parents.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	0	I was very unhappy with this office and Dr. Abuzeid.  The office staff was cold and unfriendly.  We consistently waited 1.5 hrs for our scheduled apts.  Once we were told to come on a Saturday, when we arrived nobody was expecting us and we had to wait over an hour to be seen.  Dr. Abuzeid was very focused on doing IVF, tests and procedures.  We were clear from the beginning we were only trying to determine the etiology of our infertility.  Dr. Abuzeid wanted to do things his way and seemed unhappy when we questioned him or did not agree to certain tests / meds.  We left the office due to sheer frustration and now are pregnant all on our own naturally.  I would not recommned this office unless you want to be treated like a number and do not mind if Dr. Abuzeid does not listen to you.  He may be a gifted doctor, but he is not God.  Having a baby is a miracle, not a science project.  	2	2	2	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	-1	I am very very dissapointed with this office and doctor. They did a bunch of tests, and because they could not find a reason for my infertilty, they slapped the diagnosis of PCOS on me, with no reason or symptoms to back it up! They said trying IUI wouldn't even be worth it and wanted to just skip to IVF, which is much much more expensive. He also said I would have to sign a form saying that if we concieved more than 2 babies, I would have a selective abortion, otherwise he would not do the procedure on me! It was then I knew I had to find a better place. They treat you like a # and are only in it for the money.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Henry Ford / HAP
16	1	This clinic was one of the best i've gone to if it wasn't for their care and understanding I would not have been successful. I would say luckily but it wasn't luck it was skill and willingness and their strive never to give up on me that i have a beautiful healthy baby girl today. That I thank GOd for each and everyday. And as for others complaining about extra surgeries if you'd just listen you would realize that they want to get the highest chance to succeed like they did for me. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
16	-1	Only at the first visit, the doctor and nurses were nice and willing to answer our qestions. After that, they became impatient and pushy and insisted that my wife have to let him perform two surgeries. We believed that such surgeries wolud be completely unnecesary and potentially harmful as my wife had no problem with anything. (We believed there was no female factor) He did not listen to us and even threatened us that without surgery there will be no IVF and without IVF with ICSI we will never get a baby. We left the office for good, and after several months my wife got pregnant without anything he claimed to be necessary and then we got a beautiful baby! 	2	2	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	I would totally go back to Dr. Abuzied.  He was so caring as was his staff.  My husband and I had many questions and he did a wonderful job of outlining all of our options.  I had a complications secondary to my medical conditiions, nothing that Dr. did, and he called my house several times to check on me.  Not many doctors would do something like that.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	1	I do not agree with many of the comments above. I think that Dr. Abuzeid does remember previous conversations and wants to try and help you. Some of the other staff isnt always friendly, but almost everyone that I have had to deal with there have been nothing but great!!! I have been going there for about 3 years and I have not had any negative experiences. I recommend Dr Abuzeid to anyone who says they are looking for a great office to go to.  	4	3	4	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	1	I have been going to Dr.Abizeid since 2002 he has preform various surguries and IVF cycles. He is a really great guy who truely wants to help you. I have seen him and his staff do everything they can to help. They have always answered my questions. We have had success with one IVF and that was one of the 3 that he preformed. He is a busy guy trying to keep up with the latest and great treatments. I plan going back to him one more time and I know he will do everything he can to try and make it work for us one more time.  	5	2	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	-1	This is the third IVF clinic we have been to. So I do have something to compare this clinic to. What brought us to IVF of MI was their cdc statics. Now that I have gone through 1 IVF treatment there I have to say you are treated as nothing more then a number. Don't bother asking questions. One of my questions was answered, &quot;we have been doing this for years we know what we are doing&quot;. They did not remember our history from visit to visit and often gave inaccurate information. They draw your blood in front of the entire waiting room. You wait 45 mins. before you are even seen in the mornings for your U/S, so I was late to work everyday I needed blood and U/S - which is often during IVF. Wasn't told the results of our embyro quality until I was already in stir ups, in surgical room waiting for transfer. No time to make an informed decision or even process what they were saying. Very disappointed with our treatment at this clinic. 	1	1	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
16	-1	I can't stress enough how much I dislike IVF Michigan. Everyone there is rude and act like they are doing you a favor to treat you. Those who have issues with fertility are obviously very vulnerable and this clinic only made it worse. One time they performed a procedure on me without asking me prior. When I was done they told me to stand up and did not warn me that there was going to be saline gushing out of me and down my legs. Another time after I had a conversation with the Dr. and as her walked into the hall he was dictating notes about our meeting incorrectly. He was repeating information that I gave him with the wrong facts! That is when I knew I had had enough.  		1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

16	-1	Would never go back to this office again. Treated like a number is an understatement. Was told I needed a surgery that I DID NOT NEEED. Got a second opinion and was pregnant within months. Most of the office staff are awesome, but the doctors are somet less than desirable. I would never recommend this place. If I am going to be in stirrups every week, a little compassion is nice. As far as high numbers, I guess when you are being passed through like cattle your numbers are going to be high. Remember, more numbers equal higher outcome, not necessarily quality. 		3	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	Dr. Abuzied and Staff have been so caring and wonderful to me. He found things right away that other fertility specialist could not in 5 years. We currently have 2 children with IVF through going to Dr. Abuzied. He has remembered me every time and my situation. Not sure why others have said office is dirty and unfriendly staff. I recommend him to everyone who has had infertility problems. He truley is the best! 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	There's a reason he's so busy. Look at his CDC statistics and you'll see this clinic is one of the best in the area. Who cares what his staff is like after you get pregnant&#63; Does that really matter&#63; Look at the big picture.  		3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
16	1	Most of the staff should be more friendly. They treat you like numbers. The doctor wouldn't answer many of my questions, sometimes wasn't sensitive. Overall the office seems professional. Some areas don't appear very clean. A few persons stand out positively. 		2	3	4 	Insurance:Unknown
16	1	This Doctor is very busy and treats you as well. His staff are busy and treat you as well they are not not very nice and they make huge mistakes like reading your lab reports wrong&#63;&#63; They neglect to tell you anything in a timely manner. Very unhappy customer, it is stressfull enough trying to get pregnant without having to deal with a nurses personal problems because she may or may not like you. Good luck to those of you that have to deal with that mess.  		3	3	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

Extremely dissapointed.  	4	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
17	1	Dr. Abramson is awesome.  His bedside manner is wonderful; he takes the time to answer all questions.  He went out of the way to make sure my treatment went like I wanted it to.....after chemo and radiation, I needed Herceptin for a year for my breast cancer treatment.  He transferred my Herceptin treatments to the hospital of the town I work in to save me travel time and hundreds of miles.  I look forward to each appointment with him.  I would recommend him to anyone who needs cancer treatment.  Sometimes you wait a while in the lobby, but I try now to make my appointments first thing in the morning, and the wait is very short now. If you have cancer, and want a good oncologist who listens to you, and provides excellent care, see Dr. Jonathan Abramson in Bay City, Michigan.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

I finally have my life back, it was a long hard road but it was worth the result. I have seen many other specialists and she was the only one who actually listened ,even though at first I thought her hadent.

26	1	I have been seeing Dr. Ahadi for over 6 years.  She is clearly well-trained and competent. However, I have chosen to change doctors because training and competence is not enough.  Dr. Ahadi generally spends a very short time with me, mentioning courses of treatment that I don't understand and leaving me scared and uninformed.  Thankfully, Dr. Ahadi's excellent PA sticks around to pick up the pieces.  The office is poorly run.  There is no computer system for appointment scheduling and record-keeping.  Furthermore, Dr. Ahadi's employees (with the exception of the PA) are aloof and lack empathy.  	1	4	3	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

26	1	Dr. Ahadi is great. I've been seeing her for over 20 years. Not once has she ever recommended surgery for me. I even suggested a hysterectomy the last time I saw her and she told me no. She could have easily done 2 C-sections on me, but she didn't. Both of my children were born vaginally and without episiotimies or tearing! I wouldn't go to any other OB/GYN.  	5	3	4	5 	Insurance:Aetna

26	-1	At first she seemed very pro-active to help solve my gynecological problems. Then it's almost as if she tired of me and just gave me 6 months worth of samples of birth control to get rid of me, hurrying our appointments along. I feel like my surgery with her was rushed into and now I know unnecessary and not worth it. She has not been helpful or sympathetic since then and I am going to see a specialist.  	4	2	1	1 	Insurance:AARP

27	0	Dr. Adair acted unprofessional by the things he said out loud that he should have kept to himself. He also talked fast and it was hard to ask him questions since he was in a hurry to get to the next patient. He would come into the exam room and then leave to go see another patient while leaving me in pain waiting for him to come back to give me a cortisone shot for an extremely painful back spasm. I did not find him to be sensitive or kind to me.  He did not help me when I called on a weekend for medication he had prescribed months before for two previous bladder infections, so he let me suffer in pain until I could go to the office on Monday (Urgent Care was closed). I went to Dr. Lao who was much nicer to me. The office was not open on Saturdays and the weekly hours only went to 6 P.M. so my husband had to lose pay to take time off to go to Dr. Adair. We are now going to a different medical office with a very caring doctor and the office is open until 7 P.M. with Saturday hours too. 	4	4	2	4 	Insurance:Unknown

28	1	I took my Mother to Dr. Abundis since she is elderly and a widow and had never been to a GYN in her life. She had a prolapsed bladder and needed a partial hysterectomy. Dr. Abundis went above and beyond to make my Mother informed on what the problem was and what to expect in surgery. My Mother is 75 years old and was discharged the very next day and went grocery shopping with my brother after her discharge!! She could put the young crowd to shame. Of course she didn't pick up anything, she followed Dr. Abundises orders an healed in no time. I am now  going to Dr. Abundis since my GYN retired and am taking my 17 yr old daughter. I highly recommend her and her team.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
28	-1	I saw Dr. Abundis for my annual exam and to discuss the difficulties I had been having getting pregnant. I explained my issues with not having periods and told her that I knew my thyroid was part of the problem.  Her exam felt very rushed, she didn't discuss anything with me and simply ordered blood work.  It nearly three weeks to get my results back and I was informed I could take them to my primary care doc as a follow up.  No solutions or follow up care was offered with my issues. I had to call numerous times and even went to the office in an attempt to get my results and every time I spoke to someone I stressed my concerns. I went to see a new doctor and  as soon as she saw my blood work and heard my history she diagnosed me with PCOS.  I felt the Dr. Abundis should have been more receptive to my concerns, and the office should have been quicker to return my results and offer help for my issues. I won't be going back and will not recommend anyone to this doctor.  	1	1	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

But, if you are someone honestly dealing with chronic pain , he is willing to listen and help in any way he can . My first appt. was great he treated my pain , set me up with a person to get a new leg brace, and is now researching surgeries and the latest treatments for the foot drop i incurred in my accident .Great guy, very knowledgable, i checked his credentials and I am certain after all his schooling he does know the difference between real and synthetic opiates.

He is more knowledgable with IC than most urologists I have seen, and he has successfully managed my pain for years, and has studied different treatments for me in addition to the pain control.  Because of my job I have had to reschedule/change appointment times alot, and they have always accommodated me and done what they can to help and make sure I was taken care of.

39	1	Dr.Abraham is always doing what ever he could to help me with me pain that am in all the time.I think he is one of the smartest doctors that i have been to since i got hurt over ten years ago.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
39	1	Dr. Abraham is a very thoughtful and knowlegable doctor.  No matter what type of problem or accident I have had he has always got me in to see him and took the time to figure out what was wrong.  Every time I saw him he helped me with pain management and in fixing the problem.  I would refer him to anybody that needs any kind of pain management or help with injuries.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
39	1	After having experimental surgery at the Mayo Clinic for a very rare cancer I was in pain constantly because of damaged nerves. Dr. Abraham was the only doctor that figured out how to manage my pain, and I tried many. My pain is now managable. The person that wrote the other comments must have seen a different doctor. He's the only doctor that's actually helped with my pain. His nurse is very helpful and always polite and proffesional and I've never had to wait over 10 minutes for my appointment. He was a godsend to me.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
39	1	excellent service, knowledgeable, professional compassionate 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
39	-1	Dr. Abraham was not knowledgeable about medicines used for pain, nor the differences between opioids &amp; synthetic opioids. The physical exam was not done correctly &amp; was only done once in several months; however, insurance was charged for such. The only option for pain control offered to me was a continual decrease in pain meds with no other care.  I was referred (after continually explaining that I was overcharged) to a pain clinic and was not given enough medicine to last until my visit to the new doctor.  He suggested I go to detox and screamed and yelled at me.  I have never been disrespected this bad by a professional in all my life. Unfortunately, other doctors have also heard many complaints about Dr. Abraham.  He has no conception of pain management.  	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Medicare
40	0	Huge wait times. I'm talking 1 hour for a prescription refill appointment. So bad, that after being her patient for over ten years I am leaving her practice and finding a doctor who has shorter wait times. 	2	1	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown
40	1	Dr. Adler is a good doctor. The only problem is long wait time. Wait time is atleast 2 hours. 	3	1	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
40	1	This is a small office, but the staff is great.  They are very punctual and on top of everything. Dr. Adler is a very kind and knowledgeable doctor.  However, she is not very punctual.  The wait time is ridiculous.  I had to wait at least 2 hours to be seen and I had an appointment. 	5	1	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
41	1	Dr. Aboudan saved my Mothers life when another physician almost caused her death.  I could not be more grateful. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
41	1	Taking my father to go see Dr. Aboudan was the best decision I have ever made.  We had been to numerous doctors and nobody could seem to figure out exactly what was causing my father's breathing difficulty.  Within 10 minutes of seeing my father, Dr. Aboudan accurately diagnosed him and started him on treatment.  Within a month, my father's health had improved exponentially and was he began feeling a lot better.  Dr. Aboudan was extremely courteous and always there if we needed something.  I would not feel comfortable sending my family to see anyone else knowing there is someone of that caliber in town.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

42	1	Excellent physician!  My first interaction with Dr. Agnone's office was very comforting.  The phone company was working on lines so I could not get through to make an appointment.  So I went to his office to make an appointment.  He spoke to my surgeon and found out that I had a very rare type of breast cancer.  He was talking to the office manager to inform her that if I did not call an make an appointment that the office needed to call me.  One of his front desk girl went back to the office manager to let her know that I was there in person. They gave me an appointment for Friday of that week.  Dr. Agnone came in on his day off to see me.  He was up front with me on everything. In my opinion he saved my life. I currently see him every three months for check-ups.  His chemo nurses are all excellent and always smile and are up beat.  I would highly recommend him to family and friends.  	 5/9/09	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

He is a special person and makes his patients feel special also. He is always ready to help you anyway he can when you need Him.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
43	1	Simply the best! I compare my experience with Dr. Agbabian to that of going to a good old school barber for a haircut. Instead of going to a big chain salon where they **** your hair and ship you out as fast as possible, a good barber takes his time and knows his customers! Instead of giving a cheap cut, a good barber gives the cut then an old lather and shave, giving you the best damn cut your money can buy! Dr. Agbabian knows his patients, takes his time to give you the best patient care you can ask for. Nothing, but the best! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
43	1	Unlike any doctor I have ever met. He will sit and listen to everything you say about every ailment you have. He then asks you about your diet,lifestyle and suppliments. Then you are off to a lab to get blood drawn. Lots of blood drawn. He test for a huge range of nutritional defiencies that no other Dr test for. Even CoQ10. He hammers on the vit D, mag, L carnatine, COQ10, etc. You will soon be taking cod liver oil and liking it so much you will be pushing it on others. He has talked to me for up to an hour and a half, while others are waiting, and those who wait dont have a problem with it because they are next and they will have their time too. Never in a hurry. He likes to check for toxins and heavy metals and does chelation therapy if needed. He is hard to get in to see if you are a new patient. A long waiting list but worth it. He is a great man, in his 80's and will be truely missed when he quits practicing. YOU GO DOC!!! Happy Customer 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
43	1	Very caring. Knows his medicine and achieves cures. Goes after the cause of the problem and not just the symptom.  In addition to being a DO, he uses alternative medicine where it may apply.  	5	2	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

45	-1	Dr Afsari was very misleading and very vague with his responses. Diagnosis was wrong.  He diagnoised me with unexplained infertility. He told me IVF was my only way at a cost of $20,000 per session.  My true diagnosis was uncontrolled diabetes.  Once diabtes was controlled I had two beautiful babies with Dr David Madyar through Oakwood Hospital. Dr Madyar is the best in Michigan.  Dont waste your time and money with Dr Afsari.  Not worth it.  	2	5	1	1 	Insurance:Henry Ford / HAP
45	1	Dr. Afsari was kind and caring. Both he and his staff were very knowledgeableand took the time to explain everything. My husband also had fertility issues, he addressed both of our problems with compassion. We now have four beautiful sons.  I can't express my gratitude for the gifts he has given us! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Henry Ford / HAP

45	1	I had extensive endometriosis including large ovarian endometriomas which Dr. Afsari skillfully removed.  At 40, I became pregnant the very next cycle without any other intervention.  20 months later, I conceived again naturally. God bless Dr.  Afsari for his excellent work! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
45	0	I went to Dr. Afsari for a number of years. While he was nice and gentle, I ended up leaving because I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions about how my treatment plan would go. I was also concerned because my questions were answered vaguely or not at all about my health condition, and much of the answers I was given were not consistent with other answers he had given in the past. I was worried, and didn't know how serious my condition was and what course of action to take. He wanted to rush into a procedure that I didn't think was necessary at the time. I ended up leaving, and now I'm with a doctor that agrees that I'm not ready for that procedure. One note - I cried during a particularly terrible visit to his office, and he promptly left the room with no words of consolation. I know he's not a counselor but come on! The lady at his front desk is sweet though and gave me a hug. 	5	4	3	2 	Insurance:Unknown
45	-1	This physician was arrogant and not interested in helping patients understand their treatment plan. 	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

45	1	Dr. Afsari was wonderful! He'll be going my surgery in 14 days. He took the time to make sure he answered all of my questions, i never felt rushed, he has been very thorough in explaining everything. I really felt like he cared for my health. Dr's usally give me the &quot;we'll do it my way, ive got more patients&quot; vibe, but Dr.Afsari was completely different. i loved him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

46	1	My boys have been seeing Dr. Aftab since they were born.  My oldest is 17 years old and my youngest is 10 years old.  Sometimes the wait is a little to long but that just means he takes the time needed with your child.  So worth the wait. 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
46	1	I have been taking my kids there all their life (19yrs-12yrs). My niece and great nephews go also. Dr Aftab is very knowledgeable,caring,and helpful. The wait time is minimum(which is great).The women in the office are awesome. And they will always try and work your sick child in at the last min.                                       As for the other reply about the baby having trouble breathing. The same thing happened to me. And I took my son to Dr.Aftab and found out it was not an allergy but very close to pneumonia. So this could have happened to anyone. Very rarely do Drs. have the same prognosis. I recommend Dr. Aftab to all the new moms I know. But where we live it's a drive for us,but well worth it. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
46	1	My Mom used to take me to him a long time ago when I was little, and he's been very kind and patient throughout all of those years.  As a matter of fact, my Uncle recommended him to my mother and she’s been very pleased with his staff and service.   Every time I got sick or got the flu; he is able to fix it without any hesitation.  Sometimes he would come over to my house because he’s very close to my family.  To the individual that posted about him, I’m sorry about what happened, but you should have taken your baby to the hospital immediately instead of waiting longer before it got worse.  Another thing, he has 2 sons and one of them is doing his residency in Boston, and the other is a DMD Dentist working with an associate in Davison.  So think twice before you criticize.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
46	-1	this doctor needs to retire, I took my baby son in and he was gasping to breath and I told him i think he has Pneumonia, and he said no he has a virus, told me to give him some cough syrup, and sent me home, later tha night i got a call from the baby sitter that my son was barely breathing, so I dropped everything and came home, and took him in to the hospital, they said if i had not brought him in he would have died threw the night, he in fact had Pneumonia, and his lungs were filled with fluid, I as lucky that I had told the baby sitter to keep a close eye on him and check on him every hour to make sure he was ok, because I knew in my heart that this doctor was full of it, if it was not for my natural Instincts, my son would not be here today, he is now 10 and because of this happening he now has and will always have respitory problems, so be careful with this doctor, he also has a son with the same name, I woud not trust him either, son like father! 		3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
47	-1	Dr. Afr is the most irresponsible doctor we have met. We could not get any help during the miscarriage crisis other than just being told to go to ER. No follow up calls from the doctor at all to find out what's going on with the patient. We ended up having to search a new OB during the crisis period. She never sent us or let us know the result for the blood test. We learned from other doctor that I am RH negative. If should could have done something earlier enough, maybe my miscarriage could be prevented. Her receptionist doesn't help anything either. Her office hours show from 8:00am-5:00pm, but it actually opens only from 1:00-5:00pm.  We never want to go back to that office again.  	 7/23/11	1	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
47	-1	I went to Afr after moving to the area. I have a history of ovarian cysts. After being hospitalized in May and having prior surgeries I assumed she would investigate the source of my current abdominal pain I had been to her office many time complaining of. Instead, she told me I was seeking drugs from her, recommended me to a family doc I couldn't get into for over a month and insisted it was my spine causing all my pain. After going to another doctor it was discovered I have endometriosis. Something that could have been detected by her long before had she been willing to do her job instead of wanting to get people out of her office in a hurry. After I wrote her a letter explaining the source of my pain and the frustration and hurt she put me through, she didn't even have the decency to apologize or check on my current condition. I'm still waiting on my records which I asked for back in October 2010. If I were you, take my advice and stay as far away from this office as possible .  	1	4	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

47	1	Dr. Afr will talk to you as a human and not as a patient who she is just trying to get money from. She genuinely cares about what is going on in your life and will even give you suggestions for anything out of the realm of her OBGYN duty.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Humana

47	0	I loved Dr. Afr as a person. She is very sweet and gentle and did the most painless, least uncomfortable PAPs and exams during my pregnancy. However, if you are someone who wants a natural birth, I would not choose Dr. Afr. She is very liberal with medications and interventions (pitocin, etc.), and does not hide her opinion that &quot;advanced&quot; methods are better than natural ones.  	4	4	3	3 	Insurance:Henry Ford / HAP

47	1	Dr. Afr delivered my second son. Even with her own maternity leave I only saw another doc once. She was absolutely great, and always answered any questions I had. I never waited more than 10 min. for an appointment. I had a very fast labor and it only took her like 10 minutes to get to the hospital when they called her (which was crucial, seeing that I was only at the hospital for 45 min before my baby was born). Even though I am not having any more kids, I will continue to go to her for yearly checkups.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
47	1	Dr. Afr is overall a very good doctor. She is very polite and easy to talk to. She seems very sincere and concerned whenever I come in. She's supported by a top notch staff. She delivered both of my boys successfully with no problems. Dr. Afr was also pregnant nearly full term when she delivered my 2nd son. I'd highly recommend her to anybody.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Wellpoint

47	1	I have been going to Dr. Afr for about 5 years now.  Haven't had a child but she has cared for me with wonderful bedside manner.  Went through break ups, losing my job, moving to Chicago and other stressful situations with me.  She took the time to listen to me and made other patients wait while I was talking with her.  Maybe I am the reason other patients have had to wait :).  I am very comfortable with her and she always listens to my concerns.  Even while I was in Chicago I traveled back for my yearly visit.  If you want a doctor that will listen to all that is going on and give you solid medical attention, she is the doctor for you.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
47	-1	She has horrible bedside manner and doesn't return phone calls back to follow up on procedures and patient questions.  She is trying to bill me for a copay from 2 years ago that was paid at the time of service.  Her schedule also is un-accomodating only 2 days a week.

47	1	Dr. Afr is a wonderful Dr.  She delivered both my son and my identical twin daughters.  My second pregnancy was high risk and had several issues which were all handled with the utmost care.  My daughters were delivered with a planned c-section due to some our complications.  We had a problem free delivery.  I have also discussed a VBAC with Dr. Afr.

She was rude to me and walked out of my room because I wanted a vaginal delivery instead of a repeat c/s.  Then I got a call a week later and they kicked me out of their practice at 37 WEEKS PREGNANT!!!  Horrible bedside manor, all the doctors are nice in her office at first until you reach the end of your pregnancy.  	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

47	1	Dr. Afr diagnosed me with PCO after I had been sharing my concerns about my symptoms with other ob/gyns for years (none of them mentioned the possiblity of PCO). When I was ready to try to concieve, she didn't make me waste time given the PCO and sent me to an RE. She delivered my son; Dr. Lingham delivered my twins as Dr. Afr was on her own maternity leave. Both deliveries were handled well and although I had an emergency c-section for the first delivery, I never felt panicked and always felt well informed of what was happening and why. Dr. Afr and her colleagues handled all of my concerns and questions well and really listened to me. And they were very supportive and sypmathetic when I had complications (kidney stones) during my second pregnancy. The rest of the staff is fantastic as well. They all seem to know each patient. 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

54	1	My husband and I highly recommend Dr. Adenuga.  He's a wonderful, caring, personable Dr.  Your children are in good hands.  When I first met him 6 years ago, I was completely impressed with his care and skill with babies and children.  He has taken care of 8 of our 11 children.  The kids love him! He's funny, caring and is genuinely concerned about the well being of every child that comes in there. Yeah, the wait is long sometimes, but he is doing his best to give your family the utmost care.  That is what keeps us going back to him.  Highly recommend him.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
54	1	When I had my first child, I had another pediatrician chosen to be her primary doctor. Dr. Adenuga happened to be on call at the time of her birth. After the first meeting, I knew I wanted him to be my child's doctor. He has been our pediatrician for 6 years now, and has handled every issue we have ever had with the utmost in care.  He CARES about the well being of my children. He has not ever hesitated in the past to refer us to a specialist when the need has risen.  I completely trust him with my children's health.  I wish I could find a doctor for myself who seemed to care as much as he does. He never makes me feel like I shouldn't have taken my children in - every illness/issue is important. 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
54	1	My kids love Dr. Adenuga. We have always gotten a very thorough exam. The only drawback is I have waited up to 2 hours in the waiting room before which with a sick child is not very enjoyable. He is a very busy doctor but when you do finally get in to see him, he does take his time with each child and makes them feel comfortable.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

My child was scared of doctors when we switched to Dr. Nuga, within two visits she was chanting his name everytime we pulled into the parking lot!  She was frequently sick and had to be hospitalized once for dehydration.  Dr. Nuga helped us as parents to understand everything that was happening as well as make our child feel comfortable.

54	1	He is wonderful, I work for him and he is my doctor as well...I highly reccomend him to anyone wanting a Dr. that is kind, has a huge heart, and wants that one on one time.  He is one of the smartest people I know! He has worked very hard to gain the knowledge that he has, and he continues to learn day by day! Thanks Doc 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
54	1	Very, very good with children. He in genuinine and a very, very nice doctor. Kids love him and he will always recognize you outside the office, come running to your kid and give him a big hug.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
54	1	Dr. Adenuga is very knowledgeable and genuinely enjoys working with children. He always has time for his patients and makes visits fun. My kids love him and visits are much less painful with &quot;Dr. Nuga&quot;. We highly recommend him. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
54	1	The best and most caring pediatrician you will ever meet! It may take a while in the waiting room depending on what time of day you go in but it is so worth the 1 on 1 attention you get from the DR.  		4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
55	1	HE VERY NICE HE DOWN TO EARTH. HE EXPLAIN TO YOU IN DETAIL WHAT HE GOING TO DO,HE USE WORDS THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. 	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
55	1	Dr. Acker is not only a great surgeon,  but he has a great bedside manner.  He is so caring and warm.  He has taken care of me and several of my friends as well, and we have all had the same experience.  I can't say enough good things about him as a doctor, plus he seems to genuinely care.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
55	-1	This doctor could not care less after you have seen him. He just washed his hands of people.He made a mistake and did not fix what was wrong, and now he is trying to back step his way out,saying there is nothing eles he can do due to my age,of 42 but if I was 27 he would try to repair my shoulder this is unthinkable thing to do to a person,I told this doctor that he better order a new MRI so we could see what the real problem is.If I had a choise at this time I would never see this doctor again.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
56	-1	Has nurses doing the interventions.  Will not listen to pts.  One standard method for all willing to give him your $. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
56	0	The staff are really rude. The Dr. is awesome.  	1	4	3	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
57	1	Dr. Adamczyk is very friendly and helpful with his patients. Also to mention the reason why he gets behind cause he spends the same amount of time on each patient. Also another bonus about him is that he trys to pull all strings to help ALL patients if he cant. For example if you need to see a specalist he will make sure that appointment will be set up before you leave the exam room. 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
57	0	Dr. Adamczyk is always at least an hour behind schedule.  His staff if rude.  HE can be arrogant 	1	1	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown
57	1	It is common to have an hour wait time in the lobby and then at least 20 mintues in the exam room.  Staff is rude.  Staff frequently made errors when calling medications into the pharmacy and then argued with the patient about it.  Staff also frequently gave incorrect information concerning test results.  It is difficult to get an appt with Dr. Adamczyk. 	1	1	5	4 	Insurance:Unknown
58	-1	This guy was horrible he really didn't seem to know what he was talkin about with my teeth he asked if i have ever had a tooth ache and i said no and he said well i'm gonna prescribe something anyway in case you ever get one i asked are you gonna do something that may cause a toothache he said no but in case you ever get one you have stuff on hand why would you prescribe something when there is notehing wrong&#63; then he was giving me outragious compayments i know what alot of things run at and how much my insurance covers of those things and he was a couple thousand above and he wasn't helpful at all he kept trying to steer me away from braces even though i really need them not good don't waste your time i have been to him once and all this happened i am already looking for a new dentist 		4	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
59	1	Wonderful doctor. Caring and knowledgeable and gentle. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
60	1	The best doctor I've ever had!!  I left him for a short period and tried TWO other neurologists and neither of them even came close to the quality of care and attention Dr Ackerman provides.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
61	-1	Seemed like a nice guy, just not a good doc. Was my primary physician, but when my son needed surgery, he denied that he was his patient. Had to go directly to the surgeons ourselves and at this point found out this guy basically was into being a musician, with his office front paying the bills. In fact on the elevator at St Jo Hospital, met a former patient of his who, when I told him my story, guessed that it was the &quot;musician doctor&quot; I was describing.  		5	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
62	1	Wonderful warm, and understanding doctor. Nice sense of humor and easy to talk to. Has helped me with some terrible pain with my neck, shoulder, back. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
63	1	Efficient multiple-physician office. Expect the desk folks to be cranky. I'm a long-time pt. Good chemist, good research, stays current w/new treatments. Highly recommended.  	3	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
63	1	I have been a a patient for several years.  I find he is tops and works with me on my issues.  No generic treatment here.  True, his staff does suck. 	1	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
63	-1	I tried to get an appointment with this physician and was contacted by his staff over a week later. Not only was she rude, but she refused to listen to my complaint about taking a week to recieve a call back. She talked over me and then hung up. I have never been treated like that by anyone in the medical field. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
63	1	VERY GOOD DOCTOR. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
64	-1	Most unfriendly, shrewd doctor I have ever went to. She does not listen to anything you say, she rambled off off my poor diagnosis and just turned around and left. I have a million questions and she told me to research it online when I tracked her down and tried to ask what next. She has HORRIBLE manners and no personality at all. She is the least thorough doctor I have ever been to. She just does not care...  	5	3	1	1 	Insurance:Medicare
64	1	Was refered to her by my doctor, due to his retirement.  Could not have asked for a better person to treat me.  I am very please with her. She is easy to talk with and goes above and beyond. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
64	1	very resourceful, compassionate, gives me plenty of time, addresses all my issues very thoroughly. this is a token of thank you for keeping me healthy all these years.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
64	-1	SHE IS THE MOST UNPLEASANT DOCTOR I HAVE EVER MET.  SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ME AND WAS FILLING IN FOR MY INTERN WALKED INTO MY ROOM AND ACCUSED ME OF BEING A DRUG ADDICT.  SHE SAID I NEED TO GO TO DETOX.  I AM IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE I CAN'T WALK, OR USE MY ARMS, I HAVE A DEGENERATING SPINE AND HEART PROBLEMS. THE ONLY DRUGS I TAKE ARE ORDERED BY MY INTERNIST.  SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN AND I HAD TO KICK HER OUT OF MY ROOM, MY MOM WAS THERE AND HEARD THE WHOLE CONVERSATION.  I HAD WAITED 3 DAYS TO SEE A DOCTOR AND MCLAREN SENT HER IN TO SEE ME.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:GHI
65	1	Excellent - Highly Recommended! Good man, great staff - our family physician for years 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
65	1	I have heard good things about him and how busy he is- but i was told worth the wait. defititely the case when dealing with the mass on my neck that that other doctor across the street blatently ignored. He stayed after hours- to make sure i got the pictures of my neck that day because i was so nervous. My parents go to him now too. 	 10/1/10	4	4	5	Insurance:Unknown
65	-1	I used this doctor a few years ago and it is true what others are saying about his lack of concern for your time and health. I found myself waiting for great amount of time often falling asleep waiting. Also I was seeing this doctor for over 3yrs and had a small growth the first year that the doctor stated he will watch and keep an eye on it. Frequent appointments were made but all he did was watch the growth; he never expressed concern or request of biopsy. By the 3rd year I decided to go to another doctor who did do something immediately but by that time I was diagnosed with cancer. Thank God I have recovered I should have sued Dr Aenlle but I feel blessed my health has been restored and don't feel the guy is worth the time.  If you care about your health don't see him 	 9/13/10	1	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
65	-1	Do NOT use this doctor. Summary: waited over an hour to see the doctor for an annual physical. Once Dr. Aennle came into the room he informed me that he could not perform a physical because he had people waiting for a deposition and so I left.  Upon leaving I spoke with his office staff (and later discovered they were a bunch of &quot;conveniently forgetful&quot; airheads) who informed me that I would not be charged a copayment since I was not actually seen for what I came in for. Four months later I am constantly being nagged by their biller threatening to take me to collections over a $15 copayment that should have never been billed in the first place. Prompt service&#63; No. Adequate services&#63; No. Intellectual staff members&#63; Absolutely not. Save yourself time and money- see another doctor.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
65	-1	I cannot even believe this guy has not been destroyed by a lawsuit yet. He & his staff are the most unorganized, bumbling fools I've ever seen. I don't know how he even made it through med school. He's nice, sure, but that's about it. At times I seriously thought I would suddenly see a camera crew emerge from around the corner because it was so ridiculous I must be on some new hidden camera reality show. Nope, it's just the way he runs his staff and office. SCARY!!! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
65	1	Dr Aenlle was referred to me by my friend and bingo. She was right- he is the nicest, most caring doctor. He spends a lot of time with me everytime I see him. 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
65	1	Dr. Aenlle is the best doctor I've had by far!!  The staff is very helpful and polite.  I am always able to get right in.   A great office!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
65	-1	Dr. Aennle's office closes at 7:00 pm M-Th, which is why I chose to see him over other doctors, however, I was continually called and told that the office was closing early and that I would have to reschedule.  So I did... with another doctor.  I received my last set of labs with directions to lower my cholesterol a few points, with no mention of my thyroid being totally out of whack, which is what I had suspected and went in to see him for in the first place.  In his defense, it seemed more like his staff was running the show and was giving him a bad name.   It was his nurse that missed the thyroid issues.  Dr. Aennle was pleasant to deal with, but I think his staff is reflecting poorly on him.  	2	2	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

66	1	VERY GOOD SERVICE, GREAT STAFF, VERY LITTLE WAIT.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
67	-1	Tried this doctor once, had a terrible experience, decided to give him another try a year later and had another terrible experience. First time, I went there when I was 3 mnths pregnant because I had a terrible sinus infection. He kept trying to give me a pregnancy test even though I kept telling him I was already confirmed pregnant. Once he grasped that, he told me there was nothing he could do. Second visit, I had another upper-respiratory infection. The nurse could not figure out how to take my blood pressure, &amp; the other doctor at the office didnt seem very knowledgable either. Not to mention, Dr aguirre sounds like he is about to die any minute... the office also had hand written signs that said &quot;clean&quot; &amp; &quot;not clean&quot; instead of sanitary or non sanitary for their doctorly utencils. It just seemed like nobody there knew what they were doing &amp; the place felt dirty.  	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Molina
68	1	Great doc!! Great staff!! Good experience!!!  Would go back! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	A good listener, very friendly and accomodating.  Appointments are alway 30 to 40 minutes late so bring a book. Then again, he takes his time with you and you don't feel rushed out prematurely.  	4	2	5	4 	Insurance:Henry Ford / HAP
68	1	My husband and I and our 3 children see Dr. Agrest. He is a great family doctor and down to earth and caring. I even chose for my newborn son to see him instead of a pediatrician. Very rare to find a doctor like this.  Thank God I did! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
68	1	Dr. Agrest is very helpful and funny. A lot of doctors are kind of rude to their patients or don't seem all that concerned with their health. Dr. Agrest wants to know all of the symptoms, takes a great medical history, and seems to genuinely care. Also, when I'm not sure whether or not to come in, he'll actually take my call and talk to me about my symptoms and give me an HONEST answer about whether it seems serious. Very nice guy... I moved to Pontiac but I still drive all the way to Warren to see him. 	5	3	5	4 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Dr Agrest is a great doctor.  I really disagree with the above patient.  He got my diagnosis right when no one else could 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Very personable.  I really like this doctor because I really feel like he listens to the patient.  I have been to so many doctors who treat their patients like they don't even know what they are talking about.  The way he treats a patient is different from almost any family doctor that I have had.  He doesn't give me the high horse feeling that many doctors have given me in the past.  I can't recommend him highly enough.  After seeing him one time I changed him to my primary care physician.  I really think he is that great. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Dr. Agrest's staff saw that I was in distress and could not breath well.  I had 1 hour previously been seen by another Dr. who told me to take an antibiotic and mucinex !! Dr. Agrest was alerted that I was filling out paperwork to return a couple hours later.  He immediately had his staff bring me to a room and I was seen right away ( even though it was his lunch time )!!!  He diagnosed me with COPD and wanted me in the hospital. I Didn't go but did return the following Monday feeling better, not completely well.  If it weren't for his proper diagnosis and IMMEDIATE treatment I am sure things would have gotten VERY bad over that weekend. He will be my doctor for my life !!      THANK YOU TO DR. AGREST !! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
68	1	Very caring.  Called to see how I was feeling. He is like a an old fashioned Doctor which you do not see in doctors of today. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

Tried to get her to buy another prescription   2nd time went for a swollen hand. explained hand swelled in minutes.  Dr. said tendinitis. she disagreed said take motrin.  Within an hour of visit it became painful and she was forced to go to another urgent care, who diagnosed as an infection.  given a Zpac and it cleared up.  called Park to ask for a refund of the 75.00 for misdiagnosis, they argued they spent time with her so they were due the money.  not sure how many   Companies can provide such poor service and not be required to refund money.  You are taking your life into your own hands when you visit this place…. Don’t go!  Staff& Dr hung up 3 times when we called to complain about misdiagnosis/ refund. Very unprofessional. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

79	1	The doctor’s behavior during the treatment was very rude and abrupt.  The diagnosis was perfectly good, and took care of the problem.  The billing person told the patient: “if you want me to help you, you must be nice to me”. She said that the treatment is covered by the insurance. Then she charged a full amount to the patient.  The patient wrote the last payment check for this doctor office. The office cashed it one day after the statement due date. Then the billing person mailed a new bill for the amount of $5 for the late pay. I had to make a call to clear that out.  -Get everything on writings, the acceptance of the insurance first  -Confirm the cost up front, get it in writings  -make it clear to doctor that you are a patient, and you have the right, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA), to be treated like a patient, not a slave. 	1	1	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
79	-1	There is a one hour wait in the waiting room when arriving on time for an appointment and then an additional 15-20 minute wait in the exam room. I had three appointments within the last couple of months and I waited one hour in the waiting room each time before I was placed in an examination room. I still do not know why the wax is building up in my ears so often.  	2	1	2	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

86	1	I've been a patient here for over 10 years but am switching Dr's. While the Dr. is helpful and knowledgeable, I always have to wait at least 45-60 minutes to see him. Their hours are forever changing and the staff is young and not very professional. It also seems that recently, they keep performing a myriad of unnecessary tests on me to keep me coming in once a month. He actually ordered a brain CT scan although I never exhibited one symptom of a tumor! I only get 1 month prescriptions so every month it's a battle to get them to send over a refill even though it's for a chronic issue (GERD). Going to the doctor's should not be a hassle.  	2	1	4	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
86	1	I was very pleased with my office visit with Dr. Abdolkarim. He was kind, helpful, and professional. He had very good bedside-manner.

I would recommend Dr. Abdolkarim to everyone.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

Form&#63; come in for a visit&#63; Refill--come in for a visit&#63; Havne't seen him in a month&#63; Come in for a visit.

87	-1	Quite possibly the worst bed side manner I have ever experienced.  He liked to end the minute and a half prenatal appointments with &quot;is that it&#63;&quot;.  The wait is extremely long, and he seemed to have WAY TO MANY clients for just himself to take care of adequately.  He also failed to inform me that I was a carrier of CF, in fact he told me &quot;everything came back fine&quot; several times over, and so my husband was not tested, unprofessional and irresponsible.  I am SO thankful that I was able to get new insurance and find a midwife &amp; OB/GYN that actually care about their patients and their practice (not to mention the babies that they are helping to bring into the world!).  	 8/22/12	3	1	1	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
87	1	Dr. Adelman got me through a high risk, extremely difficult pregnancy. Long story, short, I went into premature labor at 23 1/2 weeks.  I saw Dr. Adelman everyday while I lay in hospital bed for almost 5 weeks.  His knowledge, dedication, patience, professionalism, and expertise are the reason I am the proud mom of healthy 16 year old twins.  I have to say, I skipped a few annual check-ups and he really gave me heck.  He sincerely cares about his patients and doesn't suffer fools gladly.  	 5/29/12	5	4	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

87	1	Dr. A is amazing! He was so kind, helpful, understanding, and informative. I just switched to him and have been telling all of my girlfriends to switch to him as their OB/GYN. He is always calm, prompt, and caring. He never does anything unnecessary and walks you through everything. I could even pay over the phone and it took less than 3 minutes. The whole office is helpful and beyond kind.  I recommend him to anyone! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	I have been going to Dr. Adelman for years now. Id admit, he is a great doctor, but times he can have a very very dry personality, keeping you guessing. Id advise other patients to do your research because pertinent information is often forgotten. However, I believe he is a trusting doctor. Girls in the office screw up a bit too... so be on your P'S and Q's! 	4	4	4	4 	Insurance:Aetna
87	1	I think Dr. Adelman is a great doctor. takes his time with his patients and he has a great staff members 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
87	1	I have been seeing Dr. Adelman for 28 years. He is the most supportive, helpful, kindest man I have ever met!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
87	1	Dr Adelman is wonderful and very nice Dr.I took my wife Rupal Desumukh to him and I was happy that i had a very good Dr. for her. He answers any questions, spends plenty of time with you during your appointments, makes you feel comfortable and will answer and clear all the doubt I had.While delivery he was with us for the full time.I never saw Dr linke him and all the staff were very good to us.   	5	5	5	5 	Insurance: United Healthcare Insurance:United Healthcare
87	1	Dr. Adelman is very knowledgeable, prompt and he gets straight to the point.  If you have questions he will answer them and make sure you understand and are comfortable.  Recently Dr. Adelman removed at least 9 uterine fibroids from my uterus to prolong child bearing.  I had been going to other Dr.'s for years and none of them performed the test or asked me questions regarding bearing children as Dr. Adelman did.  I was VERY pleased with the surgery, recovery, and my incision is barely visible.  Dr. Adelman's staff are very friendly, helpful, and they also ensure your comfort.  I would highly recommend Dr. Adelman.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	Very prompt and matter of course.  Caring and knowledgeable.  He has delivered both my children and did a great job with the stitching after both C-sections.  The nurses said it's the best they've seen.  He is easy to talk with but bring your questions with you as he gets in and out of the office quickly.  Overall, I would recommend Dr. Adelman.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	I have been through seven OBGYNS and am glad I found Dr. Adelman. He is agressive but very conservative with safety. Other doctors just wanted to cover up the problem but he was very thurough and found out things my other doctors didn't. I know others complain about tests but if he presribes them they are for a reason. The Van****office is smaller but I like the staff better.  I am impressed with doctors commitment to his job. Previous comment was right, you will hear from him and I love how he will take your phone call if you call him. He's quick and blunt, but he will get the job done.  	5	5	4	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	I have been a patient of Dr.Adelman for 26 years. The staff is very helpfull , always on time I could never have a bad word about him. I hope he is not ready to retire.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	-1	I've been with Adelman for 1 1/2 years.  The last year, they have been very unkind, unhelpful about my birth control problems (Adelman wrote the prescription wrong, causing a lot of stress, not to mention all that can be emotionally affected due to birth control) and when he performed a procedure, he explained nothing and then rushed out of the office, leaving me very confused and bewildered.  When I told him I was switching doctors, he refused to prescribe me an extra month of birth control until I could see my new doctor.  My mom goes to him as well, and both of us will be switching.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	-1	. I have never experienced a Dr like this in my life! I went to the Dr with my daughter who is 20 and is going to be a first time mother, he was rude, cold and very unprofessional!  She is in her last trimester and suggested she find another dr because he can not communicate with them!  They are young and unsure of what is going on and why she is having some of the things happen that is happening, as a professional it is his job to talk them through it!  He was VERY UNETHICAL! I have delivered 2 children and have never came across a Doctor like this in my life!  He made unethical comments about her being on Medicaid, he is NOT there to judge her, nor does he have to accept Medicaid! I have never ever been so thrown back and speechless about a doctor in my life! 	1	2	1	3 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
87	1	I think doctor Adelman is wonderful.  I went to him for a second opinion and have gone to him ever since.  He always answers any questions I have in detail and when I needed to have surgery he explained all of my options and wanted to try the least invasive procedure first. Everything went very smoothly and I am now 9 months pregnant with our first child with no complications.  This was very different from my previous doctor.  He always has my best interest in mind and I would recommend him with out any hesitation.  In fact I have 2 friends and 2 family members who also love Dr. Adelman and have great experiences with him.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
87	1	Dr. Adelman delivered my son 26+ years ago and is still my gyn. He is very caring and helpful. I will hate it when he retires and I have to find a new doctor. He is always available to answer questions and never rushes me.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
87	1	He is a compassionate, and has a lot of knowledge and patience.  I have endometriosis, ovarian cysts as well as horrible periods.  He has seen me through a lap, and solved my premen with herbs and vitamins.  He always takes the time to talk about it.   He is just Awesome! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	Dr. Adelman is the first male GYN I have ever visited.  He was very professional and knowledgeable, as well as time efficient.  He was also available for consult after the general exam, where he offered great advice on medications, vitamins, etc.  I was comfortable, and I plan to visit his office again in the future.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
87	1	Dr. Adelman delivered my three children, he is a wonderful caring doctor.  He explains everything in great detail, he has a great sense of humor, he makes you feel comfortable and at ease no matter what.  He is always quick to return a phone call and answer any questions you may have.  He is one of the most supportive Drs. I have ever had. His staff is great, very kind and caring.  I would highly recommend Dr. Adelman and his staff to any mom to be out there.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Molina
87	1	Dr Adelman delivered my two girls and it was effortless and drama free.  I feel very comfortable talking with him about any matter.  He is very practical and funny in a dry way.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	Dr. Adelman performed fibroid tumor surgeries on me in 1991 and 2006 and both times impressed me as competent and caring and thorough.  He does things like wrap your tubes leading to/from your bladder/kidneys with metal so they cannot be nicked in surgery.  He handles high risk surgeries with a careful, practical confidence that is what you really need in a difficult case, such as you find with scar tissues and repeat surgeries.  He also checks on you every day, even weekends, which must be very tiring for him, but is great for you.  I highly recommend him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
87	1	Dr Adelman has delivered all 3 of my children.  He is an excellant, caring Dr and I have referred a few of my friends to him.  They were pleased as well.  He is always able to see you same day if needed and always able to answer your questions.  I highly reccomend him to anyone looking for a great doctor. 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
87	-1	very uncaring doctor, tried to force me into tests i did not want even calling me at work. I went to a new doctor and was not pressured into anything. my daughter is now 5 and a very healthy beautful girl. with all the tests he wanted me  to do, i was stressed during my first few months of pregnancy more than anything.  	5	5	1	1 	Insurance:CIGNA
87	1	Dr Adelman is wonderful. He answers any questions, spends plenty of time with you during your appointments, makes you feel comfortable and reassured (first time mom here!) and is willing to squeeze you in if you have a problem and need to see him. I call him at least every other week with a new question and every time, he calls me back within a few hours. Highly recommended ob.  		4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

It has been a long miserable 7 months for me and my regular doctor had recommended the Mayo Clinic because he was stumped.  A friend recommended Dr Acuna.  I found her website and found out she uses Asyra!  I knew about this machine so I made an appointment.  Long story made short.  Dr Acuna CURED ME!!!  It took about 3 weeks of using the drops as well as some supplements and I'm well.  I cannot say enough good about her.    Also I had the CSI and that made me feel real good.  I HIGHLY recommend this doctor.  And her staff is wonderful as well.   She gave me back my life! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

90	1	Dr. Adams is a briliant surgeon and has great people skills. He doesn't have an ego and will answer your questions and doesn't push surgery. He uses it as a last resort. I was so impressed with him I decided on surgery and he agreed afterwards it was the right decision. In my case my back wasn't getting any better after 18 months and he removed the impingement on L4-L3 nerve root.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

90	1	Dr Adams is one of the best doctors I have ever encountered. My wife had a benign brain tumor and he took the time to answer all of our questions. We never felt rushed, he didn't bombard us with technical jargon. He was never condesending. He treated us with empathy and understood this was a traumatic experience. I would recommend him to anyone. He seems to genuinely care about his work and the people he treats. He is an amazing human being.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
90	1	Dr Adams performed a Lumbar Laminectoy in May and a ACDF in November. He is a great surgeon. I am still having some problems I know he will figure it out and fix it. I completely TRUST him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:HealthPartners
90	1	Dr. Mark Adams is very knowledgable and I felt confident in his ability. I had to have surgery and he explained everything, showing me the scans and x-rays. There was no question I had the right doctor for neurosurgery. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
90	-1	My family doctor referred me to Dr. Adams for problems I've been having since I broke my neck three years ago. While Dr. Adams didn't do the surgery he was consulted before hand, I chose to go have a specialist do the surgery out of town. This was not a reflection at all on Dr. Adams, it was a reflection on how impressive the specialist was. So I went to see him today about some dizzy spells, unrelated to the surgery and because I chose to have someone else do my surgery he wouldn't even talk to me about the problems I'm having. His ego wouldn't allow him to help me. I can't explain how sad it is when a doctor, who is supposed to help people let's his ego get in the way of doing that very thing. My choosing another doctor was based on referrals I received from other doctors in the area and not at all a personal issue with Dr. Adams. However, he wasn't man enough to get past that and help me. In my opinion Dr. Adams is a very unprofessional doctor and a very pathetic person, how sad.  	5	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

He is excellent in his field, very logical in how he analyzed my medical situation and always recommended/took the best approach for my particular situation vs. doing what's considered standard practice.  A couple of times, he made recommendations that is not the norm in terms of standard practice but took into consideration my unique situation and needs and did what's best for me.  He is caring, has excellent bedside manner, listens and is very knowledgeable.  He is an excellent surgeon as well.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Humana

94	1	I looked for a surgeon for almost 2 years before choosing Dr. Advincula.  I had excessive bleeding that left me anemic to the point of nearly needing a transfusion. I would be doubled over in pain for 2-3 days of my cycle.   I investigated other procedures like heat ablation at Mayo Clinic but I wasn't a good candidate.  Dr. Advincula is an exceptionally skilled physician. He is patient and he treated me with respect. He has none of the typical surgeon's arrogance.  Yes, he is very busy.  Another physician did my pre-op exam. I had little to no pain after the Da Vinci supra cervical hysterectomy.  I have had NO complications.  I healed beautifully and I am Sooo grateful to finally be able to begin to enjoy my life at 40 years old.  God bless you Dr. Advincula! (You'll have to go to Florida to see him now. ) 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	i agree with the post on 3/3/11. i had a very good experience with dr. a. i just had a hysterectomy in jan. and he was really good. i was extremely scared and he too asked me if i wanted to go through with the surgery, but not in a negative way. he was making sure that if i wanted to turn back that he wouldn't pressure me to do it and i appreciated that. i think he's a great dr. and if you are able to have him as your dr. you're truly blessed. now, there were a couple of nurses in the hospital that weren't all that great, but he was fantastic.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
94	1	For those of you that had a negative experience, are you sure you saw the same Dr. Advincula that I saw&#63;  He has performed multiple surgeries on me and has always been compassionate, supportive and always has time to listen and answer questions.  I live in Michigan, and now that I am having problems again, I am actually considering going to Florida to see him.  He has helped me so much and I really do not trust any other physician the way I trust him. As for his beside manner, over the top!!!  Personally, he has never kept me waiting an unreasonable aomount of time. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
94	-1	I had surgery with Dr. Advicula a few years ago.  I never saw him after the surgery or in the hospital.  On my return visit when I told him I was still in horrible pain he said oh well he did his job and to live with it.  Another doctor who actually cared discovered I had two hernias causing the pain and I underwent another surgery to fix them. Dr. Advicula refused to listen to any complaint after his surgery. 	2	5	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
94	1	I also had a great experience with this DR. He was very knowledgeable and put me a ease for an extensive surgery. I am a critical care nurse, and I know who to stay away from.... He was not one of them :) Great experience with him and would highly recommend! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:AARP
94	1	Wonderful doctor. patient, compassionate and extremely knowledgeable. Great team too.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	I am very dismayed to see all of the bad reports for Dr. Advincula.  Perhaps I had a better experience because I did a lot of homework on my own, or perhaps because my case was extremely challenging for him.  A hyst normally is 45 minutes.  Mine was 5.5 hours.  I had 20 years' growth of endometriosis.  I'd been treated before, and ironically enough, it was a different U-M doc who refused to do an exploratory lap seven years prior.  I would have been saved a lot of physical pain and suffering and might have had a different overall outcome.  So perhaps it's the hospital that enables the behavior.  His bedside manner was good, he was compassionate, and was excellent technically.  Without his and his surgical team's expertise, I would have ended up with a colostomy and a urostomy in addition to my TAH/BSO.  So, five stars for him from a knowledgeable patient.  Don't know if that made the difference or not.  	4	3	4	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Dr Advincula is the best of the best. I had severe endometriosis and endometrioma cysts on my ovaries. After a botched job by a small town MD, I found Dr Advincula. He was able to remove most the endometriosis and the cysts (saved BOTH ovaries!) I can tell he truely loves his work and helping people. It shows in his quality of work. HIGHLY recommend to anyone facing situations needing gynecological surgery, especially endometriosis. I'll be letting him know when I'm pregnant thanks to his skills.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Dr. Advincula and his team were wonderful.  I would highly recommend this doctor.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Dr. Advincula performed my robot-assisted hysterectomy and i was extremely pleased with the results.  I was home the next day and needed only ibuprofen for pain control.  The scars are tiny and are fading nicely.  Throughout my experience, Dr. Advincula and his team were helpful, kind and professional.  They answered all of my questions checked on me frequently in post-op.  I would highly recommend this doctor and his team.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Dr. Advincula is an amazing doctor!!  He removed my uterine fibroid using the da Vinci Robotic System.  I was back to work in 2 weeks!  He is very professional and has great bedside manner!  Not many surgeons have those traits!! He really cares about his patients. He told me to contact him once I get pregnant! I was one of his last patients in Michigan before he moves his practice to Florida!  He certainly will be missed!  If I ever need his expertise, I guess I'll have to fly to Florida! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
94	0	At first I liked him.  He is very knowledgeable and told me what I should have done but when I started asking questions, he made me feel like an idiot.  I had surgery scheduled, which I was very anxious about, and he told me on that day, I could decide whether or not to keep the ovaries.  So when I questioned him about the benefits of keeping them, he became very angry.  Told me I wasn't ready for the surgery, I wasn't going to do well, in front of everyone standing there, and then walked out and said he wouldn't do it.  Said he did this before and to call him when I was ready.  I was already on the gurney. He is not compassionate and he made rude remarks to me during an office visit.  If you are looking for a kind doctor, he is not the one to see. One of the nurses even remarked that I wasn't the first one he has done this too.  	5	5	1	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Very knowledgeable. Another doctor wanted to do surgery but I waited a long time to get in to see Advincula (because I had heard good things). What a God-send. We used prescriptions to treat the issue and avoided surgery. He is so kind and extremely intelligent. I love him.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	Dr Advincula removed an ovary on which there was growing a mass (benign) and which was causing pain.  The surgery was outpatient.  Except for an infection in the incision in the navel, my recovery was quick.  I recommend Dr Advincula to any patient with a problem that might require surgery.  It was clear that Dr Advincula's staff, nurses, and other colleagues have much respect for him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
94	1	Dr. Advincula is an expert surgeon.  He listened carefully to my concerns and had a well-trained NP do my exam.  He chose a conservative approach at first, scheduling specialized physical therapy.  When the pain did not subside, he scheduled robotic surgery, took down some adhesions, and I felt better in short order.  If I were having surgery again, I'd choose him.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	I would highly recommend Dr. Advincula and his staff. Every question was answered. Not only is he a wonderful surgeon, but I found him to be compassionte and kind, easy to talk to. Likewise with Dr. Kim and the nursing staff.  I was back to work a week after my surgery.  Most people would have turned me away due to my age.  I had two very large fibroids removed and feel wonderful.  You will have to wait for an appointment with this Dr and a surgery date, but I was instantly at ease upone meeting him and his staff.  Good luck to you.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

94	1	I had a great experience with this doctor.  Yes, I waited to see him, but it was worth it.  Everyone was very curteous and knowledgeable when it came to dealing with me and my problem.  I found the doctor himself very easy to talk to and question.  He put me at ease by making sure I was comfortable and well informed with all details an aspects of my surgery.  Also, anytime I called with a question or request, my calls were returned promptly.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
94	1	I liked him. You definitely have to wait for him in the waiting rooms. However, I think the actual doctor consult is too speedy, not enough compassion to discuss your case to make major surgery decisions. I left still unsure w/ his bedside manner w/ my decisions. I didn't get the completed pros/cons. U Of M is full of gaps and miscommunication leaving so much room for many errors, medical, administrative and surgical. Don't ever get a MRI from their dept, they have residents read and have the pro's sign off and charge the insurance BIG buck$. The reports are not detailed at all of the area of concern, very disappointed. The day before and after my Dr. appt..in talking to the staff isn't great especially, the nurse assistant. She still hasn't contacted me regarding my follow up request from the office visit, very much intimidating and in a hurry. I really don't care for that type of behavior and attitude from people who are getting paid top dollar in the medical field. 	3	2	4	4 	Insurance:Unknown
94	-1	I waited over an hour from my appointment time to be seen by his resident, then even longer for HIM to see me. He refused to examine me (had a resident do it, but wouldn't examine me when she was confused about something she felt), sent me to another clinic unrelated to my problem, told me &quot;Everything is normal, I don't find anything wrong and there's nothing we can do to help you,&quot; then told my doctor that they had a diagnosis and treatment plan! The letter to my doc had some blatant errors in it about my life and medical history, including information that no one had even asked me. His whole attitude, tone and connotation made me feel like he was too disgusted to touch me--and I'm a clean and healthy individual, minus some unexplained abdominal pain! 		1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

Before the operation he was short with us.  I figured okay, no big deal.  After the surgury he came to speak with us and said, I will give you my speech and then let you ask questions. When we began to ask questions, he cut us off and said &quot;this is not necessary&quot;, the surgury went well, blah blah blah.  I'm sorry but you just performed surgury on my 6 MONTH OLD son.  I'm concerned about many aspects of his post op care.  I believe that I am entitled to ask as many questions so that I feel comfortable.

Originaly the plan was for me to stay 2 days. Till today my mobility is restricted and sometime get a sharp pains.  Prior surgery I was ensured that pains and mobility should be resolved by the syrgery 	2	2	3	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
96	1	Dr. Ahlgren has an EXCELLENT bedside manner, is willing to give his patients extended time to thoroughly explain what needs to be done, what to expect, and answers any questions I may have had.  I have never felt like he was rushing through the process of explaining procedures with me and that's something I really appreciate.  I find that he is genuinely interested in his patients.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
96	1	He is a great surgeon!Explained everything in detail,I had surgery 2 weeks ago,and am so thankful I did.Nothing short of miraculous.I can deal w/surgical healing pain,to be expected.Immediately,in the recovery room,my arm numbness and pain,GONE.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
96	-1	I was going to travel from a distance to get my back fixed (herniated disk with extrusion impairing my S1 nerve to my right leg).  Initial contact and sending MRI data went well and Dr. A recommended laminectomy/microdiscectomy and I was told to contact surgery scheduler.  I had a lot of questions and was told to send an email so they could be answered more efficiently.  I sent the list of questions 3 times and left multiple voicemail messages over a 3-4 week period without a single reply.  I subsequently decided to go for a different surgeon who is more responsive.  	2	1	2	2 	Insurance:United Healthcare
96	1	Dr A, & Asst. Mike are just outstanding in there details before operation. They do top job in getting a good proceedure, leaving no stone unturned. 	4	2	4	5 	Insurance:Unknown
96	1	Dr. A takes the time to show you with models and film what is the problem and how he will fix it. Sometimes he may be longer with a patient because he does not make you feel rushed during your appointment time. He lets you ask all the questions that come to mind during your appointment. I have sent him faxes with questions, phone number and times I can be reached and he has always contacted me answering my questions. He has always been available and not made me feel my questions are dumb or unimportant. I trust him and have faith in his surgical skills and would highly recommend him to anyone that would need his expertise.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
96	1	Dr. Ahlgren is outstanding. He is kind and generous with his time.  He has always talked with me for 15 minutes or more at a visit, unheard of for a surgeon. He is knowledgeable and adept. He replaced four of my neck vertabrate with cadaver bone 5 years ago. Explained in all in detail in advance and after. I still check in with him periodically.  I am 99% back....I would recommend him to anyone.  	3	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
96	1	Dr. Ahlgren took my physical complaints seriously (not the first doctor I went to).  The surgery was successful in relieving my long term back pain and discomforts.  His staff was equally supportive in my preparation for surgery and my recovery.  I highly recommend Dr. Ahlgren if back surgery is what's needed.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
96	-1	Worst girls in office on personnel cell phone calls while you stand & wait at the window. Then get nasty with you when you ask a question. Dr. is most inyerested in seeing you as a number & an $$$amount he can make off of you. Screwed up spine surgery really bad & would not admit it.If you want to ruin the rest of your life go have him do surgery on you.  Patient Beware !! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
97	1	One of the best doctors I have been with.  I was looking for a new primary care physician and I have found one in Dr. Abdallah.  The office just implemented new Electronic Medical Records and so the wait was a little long but worth it.  	 12/17/11	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
97	-1	The most unorganized doctors office I have ever seen.  Terribly rude staff, minimum 2 hour wait AFTER your appt time, zero follow up.  Insurance company tells me they &quot;have a lot of problems with this office.&quot;  Stay very far away...  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
97	-1	He does not care.  He's rarely available.  Has a nurse practitioner that does not know what he is doing and should not prescribe anything.  Does not answer emergency calls. 	2	2	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown
98	1	The doctor and staff are above and beyond. They treat you like you are a family member. Dr. Adler is very knowledgeable not just in his office but for info outside his office. If there is info that you need or want and if he doesn't know it he will research it for you or even subjects places to find it. And if you are a diabetic the first thing he will do is give you the Diabetic talk and he holds no punches. &quot;Diabetes does not go on vacation and it knows no holidays. This doctor puts your well being above everything. When he is with you you have his full attention. You can talk to him about anything. I love my doctor and his staff.  Thank you 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
98	1	Great physician and staff.  Very helpful.  Long wait time at the office though.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
99	1	Good Doctor. Great bedside manner. X-rayed my hand after sports injury. Helpful and considerate.  	3	4	5	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
99	-1	this doctor has diagnosed me with the wrong disease based on nothing,avoid him 	5	3	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown
99	-1	Abu Farha is the worst doctor a sick person could ask for. He is unbelievably rude and patronizing. Always tries to tell you that NOTHING is wrong but when you see another clinic doctor they diagnose you properly and find that you have diseases, deficiencies and health problems that have been undiagnosed for years. And just like the last poster stated, by that time its too late. The whole clinic should be sued and he should be put out of business. Please stay away from this clinic, I'm glad I finally got out.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
99	1	Was very helpful with his advise and recommendations.  	3	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
99	-1	I recommend leaving his clinic. He always tries to tell you there's nothing wrong and even ridicules you for saying you think something's wrong until it's too late and you're being rushed into the ER and find out you've had several diseases that went untreated for years because your doctor not only ignores your complaints making them sound like they're nothing but also fails to give you good medical advice afterwords.  	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
