1	1	Dr. Hahn is a good doctor, and the woman doctor is also good, but two woman in his staff are not very professional in my experience.  I over heard two of the regular office woman speaking very badly about the one worker who I believe does the billing as I dealt with her on the phone and found her to be extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  It's not the first time these two woman who are always there, have acted badly toward this worker. It made me uncomfortable and also shows that the doctors don't actually run the office, apparently  these two nasty clerks do. It isn't pleasant to say the least.  	1	4	4	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
1	-1	Nice enough, but didn't diagnose my problem. Just gave me a all purpose cream that did nothing. Don't waste your time. 	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
1	1	Dr. Hahn diagnosed me after 7 dermatologists over 4 years failed to do so.  He spent time with me, excused himself and came back with a text pinpointing my affliction. When a pharmacy could not mix the proper treatment, Dr. Hahn said he had the ingredients, mixed them for me and gave them to me at no extra charge.  The man is professional, diligent and caring.  I no longer live in his area of practice, but wish I could find such an able, thorough dermatologist here in Florida! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

3	-1	The worst communication I have ever had with a physician and his staff.  Couldn't remove a polyp, and wants &quot;another go at it&quot;...Total disorganization and time spent waiting for a procedure (more than four hours after original scheduling time with no explanation or apology)was unreasonable. Since procedure, doctor has never called.  Staff called with results of biopsy more than a month after procedure.  Very dissatisfied.  	1	1	1	3 	Insurance:Aetna
3	-1	I had a surgical procedure that HABER performed. ENTERYX--- the procedure was recalled because of POOR PERFORMANCE by DR's!!! Also, the material is non-removable and placed internally. THIS DR never filled out reports, disclosed PUNCTURING INSIDES, only after he was threatened legally!! He spends times in HAMPTONS as he states to everyone when they ARE WAITING to see him. HABER promotes himself--- NOT CONCERNED FOR PATIENT or PROVIDING RECORDS to SEEK MEDICAL HELP!!  I RATE This doctor a complete ZERO and to see his face smiling makes me sick for the damage he did !!! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

3	1	Dr. Haber's the fourth GI I've seen, and the first capable of diagnosing and monitoring my condition. He's THE guy that gets the most complicated, problematic cases. If you have to wait, he's definitely WORTH the wait. He's innovative, and someone that it pays to have on your side. And his assistant Lulu's terrific, too.  	 7/25/08	5	2	5	Insurance:HIP

3	-1	Nice guy, but cares only about his procedures, and how famous he can become. May be good at some procedures but did one on me that was in vogue at a brief period, and has since been taken off the market. He did it poorly too. 	1	1	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown

4	1	Dr. Haase is probably the best psychiatrist out there. She has helped me tremendously. she is genius at what she does. trust me. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
4	-1	I was sexually assaulted approximately 18 months ago. After several several sessions I became uncomfortable with the way in which Dr. Haase treated this incident. I explained to her that I did not see myself as a victim and that I felt she treated me as though I saw myself as a victim (meaning I don't pity myself for what happened and don't wish others to pity me). Dr. Haase said that she was relieved to hear this because not only did she think I portrayed myself as a victim but she felt that I needed to take responsibility for my own****! I in no way consented to what happened to me. THIS WOMAN IS A RAVING LUNATIC AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE!!! 		1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
5	0	I had an 11:00 appt with this doctor, being that I am a new patient I was there early. Unfortunately this doctor was about 2 hours late and on top of that I waited another 2 hours after my pupils were dialated. I told a technician how upset I was and could hear her tell Dr. Hahn, who was completely insensitive. I will never be going back. 	2	1	1	5 	Insurance:Unknown
6	1	I brought my mother to see Dr. Haas and he immediately put us at ease. He was warm, caring and gave my mother as wonderful (if that is possible) an experience during her radiation treatments as could be possible. I wish all doctors were like him! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

7	1	Dr. Ha is a very skillful doctor with a good heart. He always provides useful info. He is straightforward and patient when it comes to explain the medical situation. It is convenient to make appointments with him. He referred me to a very good surgeon for my colon cancer. He is very careful to remove a very, very small polyp during colonoscopy in my 4th year of cancer free. He is the only one doctor so far that I don't feel scared of needles because he is so skillful in taking blood and giving shots. It is very important that patients trust their doctors. Dr. Ha is the one that I trust fully when I need consultation and advise for my health.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
7	1	He's very nice. I became his patient like 10 years ago. And0 I still come to his office although I moved to NJ.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
7	1	Excellent service again.  He is very frank with his comments and his staff helps you make referral appointments for you.   He seems to have many patients yet you don't have to wait for your appt that long.   His explanations are very complete and on the mark.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:HIP
7	1	Best PCP I have ever had.    I am a Science Teacher and the last PCP before him just kicked me out as a doctor and did not return calls.   He just performed a gastroscopy last weekend.  He explains very clearly and offers you choices on treatment!!!!  I definitely recommend him and he takes almost all insurance!!!   He should get a Medal of Honor!!! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
8	-1	absolutely horrible doctor. I got admitted to the Emergency room and was treated by staff. After I was stabilized, this &quot;dr&quot; walks over, does nothing, then I get a bill for $500!!!! My insurance company paid the hospital for my visit ($1000) and then I get a separate bill for this man WHO DID NOTHING!!! Stay away if you value your health, patience and money. His last name - halfpenny - serves him well because that is all he's worth.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Oxford

9	1	Dr.Hall is a wonderful caring doctor.  He explains everything thoroughly and is very knowledgeable. I would be very confident in sending any of my family and friends to him.  Thank you Dr. Hall for the wonderful care through a difficult surgery.   You are an exceptional person and doctor! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
9	-1	In my opinion Dr Hall too often leaves his very sick patients to subordinates.  This can have a disastrous end for all concerned.  I am concerned that he doesn't care about his patients. 	3	2	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
10	1	to be honest, i see diane legendre.. she has helped me more than i can say..after unsuccessful back surgery and 23 days in hospital-5,5,13 with no answers, diane was able to not only answer the problem, but prescribe meds to help with the pain that was horrid before..i will say that personally, i don't like seeing dr. hallinan, but that has nothing to do with knowledge..just personality..brenda at the desk is wonderful as is priscilla the nurse...i would never thinking of anyone taking care of me other than diane.. thanks for the chance to let others know 	5	5	4	5 	Insurance:Medicare
10	-1	Dr. Changed medication, ordered blood levels checked in one week butdidn't follow-up on change in blood levels when received updated blood drawn reports and I almost died to due dehydration from a diuretic high blood pressure medication that was not correct for me.  Spent 5 days in hospital - more tests, more money spent that would not have been needed if Dr. and staff had read blood results and taken me off the new medication in time.  They advised me that my levels were in acceptable ranges(which was wrong)as when I was admited to hospital, the hospital doctor pulled those records and said they were elevated at the time the blood was drawn and I should have been advised to see Dr. and go off the medicine. I have since changed Drs.  	3	2	2	2 	Insurance:Medicare
11	1	THOROUGH 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
12	-1	The staff is absolutely rude, extremely lazy. They have no people skills. They make it seem that u r bothering them. I had to leave, I have never had a prob with the Dr (Habib) but because of his staff I walked out, a gentleman walked out and another patient argued with them about how many times she had to fill out forms (2hrs worth). She offered to pay by credit card just so the Dr. could see her. Never again.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Medicare
12	-1	Horrible office. i left before even being seen called me to go in early then had me wait 1hr 15 min to me this alone is unacceptable as i work in medical i would never make a patient wait so long. then proceeded to hear the Doctor and patients in the next room's conversation where the patient ended up in the emergency room after a procedure in this Dr's office that was enough for me. P.S they seem to push the most expensive thing on the menue sinuplasty beware... 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
12	1	I had to take my tonsils out for the second time because the first doctor did a very poor job.  Dr. Habib, on the other hand, completed the procedure brilliantly.  He is an excellent doctor who is also a pleasure to talk to.  Very personable and easy-going. I only wish all the doctors were like him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

14	-1	Extremely condescending.  Seems to think he should be worshiped.  Poor overseer of hospital stay.  Impatient with questions.  Not qualified to address real medical issues.  Staff is snippy. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

15	1	I have been seeing Rosemarie Haase for several years. She always takes her time with me when I see her, and she always follows up with me within a week of my visit for results. She takes her time with me more than the doctors do, and she seems like she knows what shes doing.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
16	-1	Did not listen very well. Had tests ordered and was never given the results. I got my own results and researched ways to help myself on the internet. I felt he had his mind made up about me, no matter what I said. Felt frustrated, and insignificant. 	3	4	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
17	1	He's a good doctor but not punctual at all. His staff schedules appointments for 1pm yet you're only seen at 2pm. Would not recommend due to his staff. Incredibly, they're very efficient at mailing the bills.  	3	1	4	4 	Insurance:United Healthcare
18	1	Good doctor.  She made me feel at ease.  A little harried last time I saw her and a little stumped about that particular issue- but I believe she knows her stuff in general.  Staff is nice too.  When I called in for a problem that overlapped with another field- her staff was quick to speak to her and give me a stopgap solution until I was able to get in there.  This is key- many busy offices- staff don't communicate with the doctor well; hers does.  FYI- I used to go to Marc Grossman, considered the best dermatologist in the city and I switched to Halem b/c I found her personality better 	4	3	4	4 	Insurance:Unknown
18	1	Dr. Halem was very helpful,polite, and knowledgeable.   the staff is the nicest I have ever met and most helpful 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
18	1	Dr. Halem was awesome, and her staff is amazing, probably the nicest group of people i've ever met in a doctor's office. Dr. Halem was amazing. Really thorough, really nice, and even took the time to answer other dermatological questions I had.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
18	-1	After waiting an hour and a half I finally put my clothes on and left.  The staff kept saying 15 minutes...oh, just 10 more minutes.  It was absurd and this Dr. should not be given more business if she thinks her time is more valuable than others.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
18	1	I went today to see Dr. Halem and I have to say that she is very nice, she knows a lot and does excellent cosmetic procedures. I'd highly recommend her. No doubt 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
19	-1	Unskillful intervention. Wrinkle filler and botox treatment ineffective - badly &quot;aimed&quot; so original wrinkle did not disappear and other wrinkles and bumps appeared. Information given in onsultations prior to treatment was misleading, as to price and treatment itself. 	3	1	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown
20	1	Excellent doctor. Very dry personality but who cares. He knows what he is doing. If find the staff a bit confused and nobody calls you back about test results unless you remind them. I still would not go to anybody else.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

21	-1	Horrible service.  Avoid at all cost.   This whole facility is all about money and cares nothing about the patient.  I was abandoned in the middle of surgery, told to eat dirt by Dr. Halliday.  He lied to my face several times,  breached his contract and is costing me thousands to fix a botch surgery. 	 8/25/12	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
21	1	I have been going there for years and i will keep going back for all my facial needs 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
21	-1	very dissatified. unpleasant experience. the doctor seemed rushed. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
21	1	Before leaving the area six years ago, I was a patient of Dr. Halliday for many, many years.  He got me through some very tough nasal and allergy illnesses.  He did surgery on my mother, me, my daughter, husband all with 110% positive results.  When another ENT had me lined up for sinus surgery, he read the tests, and determined it would be very risky and not needed.  He's always been right on and available.  Staff has always treated me kindly.  His Allergy nurse is the best around.  I will be going back to him on a yearly basis, traveling from SC  to Syracuse, just for the expertise from that office.  I can't thank him enough for all the help he was throughout the many years I was his patient.  Very gentle, kind and knowledgeable.  	3	3	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
21	1	Dr. Halliday is a wonderful and very sincere doctor. He doesn't rush you thru your questions, is very calming to be around, and does excellent work to boot! I recently had CO2 laser resurfacing done for some deep acne scars, and I am already quite impressed with the results. He has a good reputation around town and rightfully so. The nurses are fun and friendly as well. both Dr. Halliday and is nursing staff seem to genuinely caren about what they do. A+ all the way :) 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
21	-1	i truly hope this doctor burns in hell. He not only ruined my life but he cost me double than what a normal rhinoplasty procedure would cost. I had to have it done all over again by another doctor in the area. He ruined my nose and i know he ruined other peoples faces as well. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
21	1	I had a rhinoplasty and septoplasy done.  Dr. Halliday could see that i was nervous, he not only answered all my question, but he also gave me reading material to take home and review.  I called the office 5 times before my surgery and each time someone called me back within an hour.  By the time i had my surgery, i was no longer nervous.  12 days after my surgery i went to a party and no one thought i had surgery just last week. My nose healed nicely and looks great!  Its been three months since the surgery and i have absolutely no pain.  I love it and wish i had found Dr, Halliday earlier.  He did an amazing Job!  He may not be very personable, but his work is awesome. Anyone considering getting your nose done, should go see him.  You wont regret it. 	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
21	-1	Went in for chronic Rhinitis, was told needed surgery. Was allergy tested then given drops which made everything worse. Again told surgery necessary but when I asked questions they were not answered, I was brushed off.  Fortunately got second opinion and did not ever have sinusitis, no anatomical abnormalities.  Surgery would have done nothing.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
21	0	I went for allergies and after calling and waiting on my prescription to be filled for a couple of weeks, I called again to see what the delay was and they said they were very busy and besides that I would have to pay for the medicine cause they were changing their CODES and insurance may not pick it up.  They had no clue whether insurance would or not 	1	1	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown
21	-1	Dr. Haliday is an ENT who (unfortunately) also has board certification in facial plastic surgery. Two years out of surgery I can only say that he does both rather poorly. I went to him for both a septoplasty and a rhinoplasty. Unfortunately, I still cannot breathe and the nose I had before the surgery is the same one I have now--well after the surgery. This was, on my part, a very costly mistake in judgment and I would caution anyone against utilizing this physician for surgery purposes. Also of note is that this doctor's nurse practitioner was very rude when I went in for an appointment post-surgery when the doctor was on vacation. The office practice is overly busy and the small waiting room is often overly filled with people so you have to stand and wait. The front office staff barely make eye contact with you when you come in. You can then wait a very long time to be seen. A cautionary tale to anyone considering this physician surgeon... 	1	1	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown

27	1	Dr.Hakimi helped us to be able to conceive healthy twins BH&quot;, and have a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery. He also was the mohel at our son's bris. He is gentle, compassionate, and extremely good at what he does. He is a very sought after doctor and busy, and it's because he is an angel with wings. I recovered so well and quickly from my c-section thanks to his amazing care. I have never known a doctor other than my allergist, to be so dedicated, patient and genuinely caring of his patients. He always takes the time to listen to you and do a thorough job examining you. He also is not an alarmist, and is careful not to scare his patients. This is such an important skill for someone who does the delicate kind of work he does. I drive an hour now from Monsey to see him because I wouldn't dream of entrusting my pregnancy to anyone else.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

I absolutely love him and would recommend him to anyone! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
28	0	Where should I start&#63; The overcrowded waiting room with outdated magazines &amp; an intermittently working tv&#63; Nah. I only get 1000 characters.  1st - you need to budget 2 hours for a routine office visit. You sign in (on a piece of scrap paper - don't those drug reps have pads they can give them&#63;) then wait 30 + minutes to be called to make your copay. Then you wait another 30 + to be called in by the most personality-less nurse ever. She's seriously a robot. Then you wait  30+ minutes for the doctor. He rushes through the appt, doesn't listen to a word you say, even if you tell him, &quot;I have a lot to talk about,&quot; he only half-listens. He will nickel &amp; dime you for everything &amp; even charges you for follow-ups. You think your office visit copay covers stuff like this, but before you know it you have a huge outstanding balance for all sorts of weird stuff that you thought was covered. This guy is a crook who cares only about $. Stay away. Far away.  Hopefully I can find another doc soon.  	2	1	2	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

28	0	Ridiculously long wait time. Waiting room is too small with only 10 crammed chairs, a, TV that cuts in and out every few seconds, and usually more than 12 people waiting at one time for an appointment. On average, I have waited at least an hour to get in to see him, only to be seen for roughly 5 minutes (if that.) My longest wait time was over 2 hours and 45 minutes for an appointment that was scheduled 4 months ahead of time. Make sure you bring a nice long book. Also, payment is pretty much cash only.

29	0	He has tarrible bedside manners.Please don;t go to him, I went to him and I'm looking other doctor and I'm in second trimester.. He hardly spends time with u. never calles if the test results are not normal and many more resons. Im just so uhappy with him. he is in rush all the time. He can't wait to get read of u and have lunch...So unprofessional.maximum time he will spend with u is 5 minutes. That's all.  	3	3	2	3 	Insurance:Oxford
29	1	I love Dr. Halper and his PA Regina. He delivered my first child. I found him to be &quot;odd&quot; but highly sufficient. I would recommend him to my friends.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:GHI
29	1	Dr. Halper is one of the finest doctors I've ever had.  It was actually for my wife and for delivering our baby.  A little quirky but his knowledge is second to none.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	1	He is the best doctor. He is very knowledgable. I had 2 delivaries with him: one regular and one c- section. He was in the hospital with me all the time. He doesn't like to explain things too much but he is the doc one can trust.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	-1	Horrible horrible doctor!!! I went to his office at 20 weeks preagnent after switching from hospital care.  First appt I was seen by PA, she was nice, second time, I was seen by Halper, he started to talk down to me and raise his voice with me about not having my results back for some tests which were ran.  I attempted to calm the situation and introduced myself (he never introduced himself) but then he snapped on me asking me &quot;whats your problem&quot;.  I told him that he was being rude to me and he turned around and said &quot;I am not being rude to you, obviously you have some other problem.&quot; Furthermore, as I was waiting to be seen, he walked out quite a few times and yelled at the girls who work for him in front of the everyone in the waiting room.   PLS PLS do not go see this doctor, he is VERY VERY rude!  No manners at all!! 	3	2	1	3 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	1	I went to many GYNs before coming to this doctor and I am very happy I found him!He is very responsible, intelligent, knows whats he is doing and is really dedicated to his profession. He was with me all the time at hospital when i had a risk of miscarriage.Waiting in the office not so long-max. 1 hour(to compare-my visit to the eye doctor takes usually 2.5-3 hours).Yes, many people in the waiting room, but do u think that a really good doctor should have empty waiting room&#63;&#63;&#63;The staff is pleasant and helpful.His PA- Regina is the nicest person I ever met, very knowledgeable, compassionate, capable, she takes the blood so I never feel any pain!I highly recommend this office to my  friends and other people. PS: Comparing to others,  Dr.  Halper never!!!  asked  me to pay him for pregnancy and delivery! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	1	this doctor is the best!!!he take care me with my second pregnancy with twins.he always see me in the time on my apoitmant,he always give me good recomendations about my pragnancy.i was in the hospital 4 time and he always came to me in time.and i want to tell, big thanks him for my very fast and easy labor,naw i ejoy my two girl.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	1	I delivered my 1st baby with him. He has an odd sense of humor but knowledgeble. Although he doesn't like to listen and responds that he will charge extra for any questions, that would be funny but he leaves right after so it's partially true! Doesn't explain whats going on. Each office visit wait for way over an hour maybe even 2 hrs which for a pregnant woman way too much and unreasonable. Had c/s delivery because of stress and not knowing if he will come to the hospital,due to that day was major holiday. felt rushed in a way and uncomfortable with his sense of humor. On a positive note, c/s scar healed nicely and its barely visible. At a post delivery follow up visit after waiting for 1 hr. inquired about waiting time, to which they respond as unknown (whole room was filled with pregnant women).  also,shared with staff that i was breastfeeding and inquired about waiting time, he came out and said &quot;leave!&quot; breastfeeding mom is less likely to wait up to 3 hrs 	4	3	3	4 	Insurance:GHI
29	-1	Don't use this doctor if you want to have a good experience naturally delivering your baby.  	2	2	2	2 	Insurance:MB Health
29	-1	Maybe he is knowledgable--not to me. Very inattentive, doesn't like to listen to the patient. Always in a rush, rude. His stuff consists of girls in their early twentieths who do not have basic knowledge of communicational ettiquette--rude on the phone. There is no order in his office-had to wait MINIMUM 45 minutes to be examined EVERY visit. Had TERRIBLE experience in Methodist hospital. I was left alone for a  couple of hours, in pain, screaming for someone to come in into the room--literally. English may be my second language -but,guess what-i know what i am saying...  Will definitely change the doctor when i get pregnant again. Hi is nice when it comes to cash. He is nice when you have twins, which is considered a high-risk pregnancy, because he is clearly afraid to be sued when something goes wrong.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:GHI
29	-1	He is terrible!!!!! He does not answer your questions and all he kept telling me was dont worry about it. I switched and got a better work-up from someone else.  	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	-1	He was terrible in delivery room. He is cutting almost all his patients, because of not wanting to wait. He came to delivery room and told me to push, then he left. I started to push, then I understood that I'm feeling baby coming. When he came I told him that the baby is coming, and I feel that his head almost is out. Halper told me that it is my imagination without even looking at me. And he left again, I stoped pushing because I've been scared that my baby will go out without a doctor. 15 minutes later dr. came back with coffee and bagel. My husband told him to look at me, but dr. was eating and without hurrying. Then my husband screamed at him and only after that dr. came to me to see what is going on. He saw that the baby was going, he didn't want to wait and cut my VAGINA!!!! He sew it but the stitches came apart, and 6 weeks later he told that it is fine. I went to other 4 doctors just for opinion, and 3 of them asked me:&quot; It was dr. Halper&#63;&quot; Now I have to do plastic surgery!!! 	3	2	1	2 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
29	0	He is knowledgeable, but unresponsible.I've decided to find other doctor next time. 	5	3	2	4 	Insurance:Unknown
29	1	I had him for the first two deliveries. He is knowlegeable doctor, but over protective. I was really happy with the first delivery and very disappointed with the second one. I think he has to many patients and no time to rest between deliveries and office appointments. His staff is very helpful.  And I loved his assistant- she is great! 	5	4	4	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
29	-1	The most horrible experience and medical service I've ever got. Very greedy. Don't care about the patient only about how much he can charge his insurance.  	1	1	1	2 	Insurance:Aetna
29	-1	The worst doctor I've ever seen in my life! Did not communicate to me, did not remember me by my name, saw me 3 times during my 32 weeks of pregnancy. I finally left to another doctor, because I got such a bad bad review from the hospital's (Methodist) nurses that work with him. Once nurse told me: &quot;He is terrible in the delivery room&quot;. It was enough for me change to another doctor. Do NOT go to see Dr. Halper!!! 	5	4	1	1 	Insurance:CIGNA
29	1	Dr. Halper is the most attentive and knowledgeble doctor i know.  I had a very difficult twin pregnancy with premature labor and doctor Halper did my prenatal care visit  at my home, even brought his portable ultrasound machine to check the babies every visit.  Never had to wait at his office, he took me in right away due to a high risk pregnancy.  My delivery was easy, C-section scar is invisible as if i had plastic surgery.   very happy, would only come to doctor Halper in the future 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
29	1	basically takes care only of pregnant patients -doesn't like to deal with regular patients, all non-pregnant women are treated by his medical assistants who are not always and completely knowledgable about the problems; doesn't like patients who ask questions - he wants you to follow his advices blondly without asking questions even if you have doubts 	4	3	3	5 	Insurance:Unknown
29	1	Dr Halper is the best!!! Very knowledgeable and attentive to his patients. Competent staff at office and Hospital (Methodist). Never waited more than 30 minutes at his office. Would absolutely recommend him and will certainly use him if there is a next time. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
29	1	In general, Dr. Halper is nice but too busy to give his patients personal attention. His office is clean. His staff is supportive. However, I usually have to wait about an hour for my appointment. I gave birth to my son in Methodist Hospital. I didn't like the hospital, and now I am considering finding another doctor who is affiliated with another hospital.  		1	3	4 	Insurance:GHI
30	1	Basically, I owe my life to Dr.Haag. He detected an abnormality and insisted tghat I go immedfiately to an oncologist where it bwas dertermined that Ihad col9oin cancer,stage one.

30	-1	This Doctor is by far the worst doctor I have ever met. He was rude to me and my own mother. He is sloppy and he is very unprofessional. He has no respect for women and is often very rude to his staff. He makes me feel very unconformable every time I am their. I am in the process of seeing someone else.  	3	1	1	1 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
30	-1	He claimed I had a lump somewhere in my abdomen...he gave me a *physical* in under 30 seconds for college.  I have no lumps; I get regular, thorough OBGYN exams (a female) and they have never found any such lumps.  There is nothing wrong with my abdomen.  I have no pain and no lumps.  He is after one more buck, that is all.  A routine college physical but it needs to be done thoroughly, honestly, and professionally.  My mother is an RN. 	1	2	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
30	1	Took my mom (age 87) to Dr. Haag after her previous physician relocated out of our area.  She has seen him many times and likes him a lot.  He takes his time with her, asks many questions and listens to what she has to say.  Since I attend the appointments with her, I hear the way he speaks to her, and have never been displeased.  He is gentle, friendly and thorough.  We have never had a problem with him or his staff. The office is not &quot;state of the art&quot; (located in a former home) but is functional.  	4	4	4	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
30	-1	This doctor is the most rudest, arrogant pompus ass I have ever seen. He won't let you speak the entire time you are in the room, dosen't want to hear your symptoms.

30	-1	This Dr is THE RUDEST HUMAN I HAVE EVER MET...HE IS THE CAUSE OF GREAT PERSONAL ANGUISH AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. THE EXAMINING ROOMS ARE FILTHY AND HE GAVE ME INVASIVE TESTS I DID NOT NEED NOR ASK FOR. HE SAW ME 3X IN 2 MO AND DID NOT REMEMBER A THING ABOUT ME SO I GUESS HE FAILED TO TAKE PROPER NOTES. HE FAILED TO PROVIDE ME WITH MEDICATIONS THAT WERE MEDICALLY NECESSARY. THE PRESCRIPTION HE DID WRITE HE WROTE WRONG. HOW SCARY IS THAT&#63; DO NOT GO TO THIS DR***STAY AWAY!!! TRUST THE REVIEWS..

34	1	Great doctor. I am not sure why he would personally get these negative comments..... however, and a warning to possible new patients, the wait is so long it is ridiculous.

34	1	Dr. Haimovic one of the best doctors I have ever been to. He is compassionate and an excellent diagnostician.. I have had multiple neurologic complaints over the past 20 years and he always was able to help me. I know sometimes you do have to wait to see him but its worth it. He has taken very good care of me as well as my family members.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
34	1	I have been extremely satisfied with every aspect of the care I have received from Dr. Haimovic.  I have never met a more caring, compassionate and tremendously knowledgable doctor. He diagnosed my condition that other doctors had not even mentioned as a  possibility.  The medication he presribed was right on target and I am back to feeling myself again.  I truly can't thank Dr Haimovic enough. I must stress how patient he was about explaining my condition and treatment options.I really felt that the treatment I received exceeded my every expectation.  The office staff was respectful every step of the way.  From my iniital phone call to my expereience in the office.  They were kind, considerate and a pleasure to deal with.  Addtionally, I was seen at my scheduled appointment time.  I did not have to sit and wait either in the waiting room or the exam room.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
34	-1	Absolutely horrible. I waited over 2 hours to see him because he overdosed me on medication for epilepsy. I advise you to stay away from their office entirely. They make you wait Forever.  	2	1	2	2 	Insurance:Oxford

34	0	Staff is VERY VERY rude. The Wait is VERY long. He ordered a lot of tests, and then guessed at what it was, since the tests all came back negative. He put me on 12 different meds over a 6 month period and none worked. I went to another doctor who figured out what I had after 2 visits, and I am really close to completely cured. I can't get back the 6 months of my life I spent in a cloud from all the meds he just prescribed blindly. Do not waste the multiple 3 hour waits and the frustration of his cold blooded staff.  	 11/12/09	1	1	3	Insurance:GHI
34	1	I also waited 3 hours in his waiting room and when I finally got to see him, he spent a total of 5 minutes with me. Offered no advice other than go to physical therapy. You'd never know he has been treating me for nearly a year. Found his apology for the long wait to be phony. 	2	1	3	4 	Insurance:Unknown
34	-1	Waited 3 Hours for the visit. He ordered a ton of tests and never got back with results. He came very highly recommended but I am not sure what the fuss is about. He didnt offer me any help with my back pain.  	2	1	2	2 	Insurance:GHI
34	0	I felt like he just want me to go back for meds. Waiting time always 2-3 hour, even if you call a head of time to ask is he runing on schedule!! Once he finaly sees you he rushes.. He in it to make money..that's all he cares. Actually he said&quot; I could give order physical theraphy, but it's not going to help&quot; Guess, what I went to an other Doc.  No more meds for migraines! thanx to onther doc! 	2	1	2	4 	Insurance:GHI
34	0	He knows his stuff.  But - you wait in the waiting room for about 2 hrs, then in a gown for 45 minutes.  During the appointment he did NOT listen to me, and stepped out of the room to yell at multiple staff members.  I found him cold and uncaring about my problem.  When my pharmacy later had a problem with the medication he prescribed, I spoke to him over the phone and rather than fixing the problem, he literally spent the time insulting me in a way that I felt was verbally abusive.  He also refused to acknowledge that I could be in the amount of pain I am in, as it is not a classical symptom of the disease I have, yet the classical symptomology is having random, unknown amounts of pain, including severe pain that can require implanted devices to treat.  At this point I am at a loss because I need an MD who knows the disease, but also one who believes me, understands that I am in pain, and does not make me feel horrble.  	5	1	1	5 	Insurance:HIP
34	1	This doctor knows his stuff.  He is amazing, and you will feel like, finally, I found someone that can help me.  That is how we felt.  We are still going for tests, but, we are so impressed with him.  We waited for two hours for him and he was well worth the wait.  He is a top doctor.  	5	1	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
34	1	A wonderful, charming doctor with great bedside manner and very knowledgable. Very well-known on Long Island. May sit in his waiting for a long while but once he sees you, he does not rush you and you get his complete undivided attention.  He is well worth the wait!! 	5	1	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

42	1	Absolutely the best Pediatrician my wife and I have ever dealt with. We have 3 children and had been to 3 other Pediatricians in the area before switching over on the advice of my brother (also a doctor). Best bedside manner and actually cares about my children's well being. My kid's love Doctor Hajduk. I have had no copay or similar issues because I know that is the way the insurance companies setup the rules and know to separate the 2. My children's care comes 1st. We just had our 1st visit to their brand new office about 1 mile away. Very nice, comfortable and clean. They even have a separate nursing room for mothers. I had not seen that before. We occasionally have to wait a few minutes, but never too long. I have never been to a Doctor in my 40+ years where I did not have to wait. We left other pediatricians in the area because of 30min+ wait times or unable to get an appointment for weeks at a time. They are by far the best on every level. Highly recommended.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
42	1	She is a wonderful doctor! Takes the time to listen to concerns and truly cares for your child. HOWEVER, her partner is the complete opposite. Dr. Danzi makes everyone leave!  In recent years the office has gone downhill. It's a revolving door for employees, office is dirty, wait is long.  Several of my friends have left the practice and I recently left after being there for years. Dr. Hajduk is excellent no doubt. The practice as a whole is horrible! 	2	3	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
42	1	I completely TRUST Dr. Hajduk.  I went in for my son's 15 month well check and I was unsure about getting the flu shot for him.  Dr. Hajduk took the time to weigh the pro's and con's of whether or not to vaccinate for the flu.  She really listened to my concerns and understood me, I was afraid to vaccinate, but also afraid not to.  She told me that she gave the flu shot to her daughter when she was 6 months old and she was absolutely fine.  That made me feel so much more comfortable.  Some of these negative comments about waiting time and the complaints that the office only accepts cash are truly ridiculous.  The fact that my son gets the excellent care that these doctors provide is the most important thing in the world to me.  More important than money or time.  My sister-in-law has had some awful experiences with other pediatricians in the area and she just switched both of here kids over to this practice.   Highly recommended!!! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

She is very caring and I agree with a great bedside manner! 	5	2	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

42	0	Absolute disgrace-worked with our children for 4 years and when the staff was rude and unprofessional when making a well-check appointment both doctors refused to speak to us- as per their receptionist and stated by Dr. Hajduk,:&quot;I have a biller to do bills, a receptionist to make appointments and I check sick kids.  I don't deal with this-it is not a priority.&quot;  This lack of respect proved that both doctors in the practice never truly cared for our children, and not worthy of our respect and trust.  	1	4	1	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

42	1	Here's what is amazing about Dr Hajduk:  She actually listened to my opinions about my childrens' health.  She didn't rush us although I knew she was busy.  She didn't talk down to my children.  She was nothing but supportive and caring.  She gets an A+.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

How can you treat your patients like this&#63;! Especially on their first visit&#63;! Obviously they have all my information, it's not like I'm trying to pull one over on them.

He now takes care if our extended family. He treats my husband's glaucoma and takes care of all three of my kids, including one that is special needs. He is so patient, and sweet and explains things so well. He is fun for kids and he is very thorough. The staff is so caring and kind and the technology is definitely up to date. It is amazing how highly he was recommended and I definitely see why.  I highly recommend! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
48	1	I suffer from depression and was scared to get bad news. I was assuming I had a cancer in my brain. Anyway, Dr. Todd explained everything to me and that what I had was not anything serious or dangerous. In fact, I found myself laughing throughout the exam ebcause he made me laugh. He kept saying &quot;I just heard you laugh. Now my day is complete.&quot; I haven't laughed in a few months. I would go back to him, just for the sake of going back. It was a pleasure and he was great. He was exactly what I needed. I just wish my sychiatrist was this good. I want to go to Dr. Todd for that too, but he told me that isn;t his specialty anyway.

50	1	Dr. Hadden is great!  Answers questions, takes time with me, is reassuring and seems very competent.  I have dealt with another doctor in that office who not only misdiagnosed me but was abrupt and would not return calls about her wrong diagnosis.  I did not care for the staff in the office either but Dr.  Hadden made up for the bad experiences and misgivings I had in that office! 	3	3	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
50	0	As everyone else said, the staff and waiting times are a disaster. You're lucky if you wait one hour. I loved Hadden until I got pregnant and started having complications. He would take two days to call me back and then failed to diagnose my problem. I had to change doctors to be taken seriously. 	1	1	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown

50	1	I have been seeing Dr. Hadden for at least 12, He's treated both of my pregnancies. He is worth my one hour commute from NJ, I wished the waiting situation will change. 	3	1	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
50	1	Dr.Hadden was referred to me by a colleague who had had both her babies under his supervision. I have been to him twice so far and have called him twice to get referrals. He is very patient and explains things in an easy to understand manner. The doctors he refers you to are also of a very high standard. He returns calls, but not always on the same day. As others have mentioned, you usually have to wait 1-2 hours (or more!). They HAVE to do something about this. I have never had such long waits with any other doctor. His staff always seem to be in a hurry when you call, and if you ever need them to fax over information or act on something, you need to keep following up and essentially nagging them till they get it done.  	2	2	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
50	1	I have been seeing Dr. Hadden for many years and have referred a number of patients to him.  He is patient, knowledgeable and just an overall good doctor.  His staff definitely leaves a lot to be desired - they are curt and definitely overbook (an hour is a short wait).   However, he is worth it! 	2	1	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
50	1	Dr. Hadden is great – very knowledgeable, never rushes you out and always answers all your questions but he has to do something about his staff. I’ve never had such a bad experience with staff before – it take them hours to return urgent calls and sometimes they don’t even bother to do it. Also, I always have to wait for at least an hour to see him – I think, they are constantly overbooked and they should do something about it.  	1	1	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

Usually a busy place though, but not busy for my appointment today. Hope I can get in to see him if needed in future.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

57	1	The Doctor and his staff are unbelievably efficient. I received a full glaucoma exam in one visit whereas my previous doctors split the exam and tests into 3 visits. My time is valuable and they explained everything and answered all my questions.  The exam takes a little longer but it is well worth the time 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Medicare
57	-1	Dr. Melvin L. Haller and Dr. Chad may be good doctors but due to overbooking they do not provide enough time towards the patient.  They are more interested in number of patients rather than the quality care.   There is no respect towards the patients (who pay them!!) by them by or their staff. Average waiting time is about three hours. 	2	2	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown

66	-1	I went to Dr. Haber  becaouse of valid symptoms and concerns occuring over a long period of time. I was referred by his colleague. I didn't need his indifferent and condesending attitude.  He does not look at you when you are speaking . He challanges everything that you say, as if you made it up. He focuses on his computer keyboard , rapidly typing. When he finishes , he tells you to make an appointment for the following  year.  You know at that moment that this physician could care less about helping you.  	5	3	1	3 	Insurance:United Healthcare
66	-1	I really have never had a worse experience with a doctor. He asked me how I felt, when I said I felt like cutting my skin off with a knife, he told me it didn't matter how i felt. All that mattered were my numbers. I found him to be both condescending an unsympathetic. Spent more time telling me about a Yankees game he had gone to than actually listening to my problem. DON'T GO TO THIS MAN. 	4	5	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
66	1	I'm surprised by the poor ratings. I thought he was extremely punctual and spend nearly half an hour with me. He even personally performed an ultrasound on my neck. I've seen a lot of endocrinologists since being diagnosed with thyroid cancer several years ago, and this guy is as good as any.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
66	1	As a thyroid cancer survivor, I began seeing Dr. Haber two years ago. I've found him to be a very caring and thorough doctor. He does his own ultrasounds, and I never feel rushed or dismissed when I see him. He actually spends more time reviewing my history than any other doctor I have. He personally calls to let me know about testing results, and he and his staff have been great about calling in prescriptions when I needed them. I'm very happy to have found him.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
66	-1	I consulted with Dr. Haber once.  While I should be under continuing care for a thyroid condition, it will not be with Dr. Haber.  He barely gave me the time of day and didn't bother to hide the fact that he was quite humored by my concerns.  I should note that I am not a high maintenance patient nor am I regarded as stupid or histrionic.  He might have been having a bad day but in the event that my experience was typical, I would suggest that you seek care elsewhere. 	5	4	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
66	-1	I have never been treated with such disrespect from a medical professional in my life. I waited over 45 minutes in a small room and when he finally did see me, he scanned the questionnaire I was told to fill out, made a joke about me having a ton of problems and asked that I give him, just my top 3. This appointment was scheduled 2 months in advance and this guy couldn't even take 2 mins to read my paperwork and listen to what I had to say&#63; If that wasn't bad enough, his tone with me was completely hostile and condescending. After waiting 2 months to see this doctor and physically feeling pretty miserable, understandably you can get your hopes up. When that same doctor talks to you like you’re an enormous waste of their time, well, you might understandably get upset. Luckily he was there to then diagnose me with depression and suggest I get therapy.( In 5 minutes, amazing.)  I would love to write what I really think of this guy here. But a simple, don’t go to him should suffice.  	2	1	1	1 	Insurance:Aetna
66	-1	I was under the care of Dr. Haber for thyroid cancer. I had been in remission for five years when, after a routine scan, he concluded that my cancer returned. I asked him if this could be a mistake since I had been having regular ultrasounds that showed all to be clear. Rather than investigate, he insisted that I had cancer and urged me to be treated with radiation immediately. After undergoing treatment, I went to MD Anderson Cancer Center where I learned that the initial scan was a false positive. I was cancer free.  A series of CTscans was able to contradict the initial thyroid cancer scan – yet Dr. Haber never offered me this option. Having needlessly undergone radiation treatment and suffered both physically and emotionally, I want to caution others.  	4	5	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
66	0	My experience with Dr. Haber was mixed. He is very knowledgeable and competent with thyroid diseases, and the front desk staff was very nice and efficient. However, after waiting 1.5 months for an appointment, I waited one hour after being roomed in, only to be met by the doctor with a very &quot;9-5&quot; attitude, as if he was only there because he had to be. Additionally, he was very short with me, often cutting me off mid-sentence while I was trying to ask questions or explain a concern. He was not compassionate or concerned, simply doing his job. As I am far from a high-maintenance or careless patient, I felt very put-off by the appointment and will not be following up with him.  	4	2	2	4 	Insurance:HIP
66	1	I met Dr. Haber for the first time today. My overall impression was that I was in the presence of kind, knowledgeable, honest physician. I needed reassurance and guidance and that's what I got. If you are thinking of going to see, don't hesitate. By the way, the staff was extremely nice. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
66	1	Was able to diagnose Graves Disease and prescribe medication dosage where I felt better in a few days and went into remission fairly quickly. Now, five years later, I am still in remission. I totally recommend this doctor for thyroid disease. 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

70	-1	Edited previous review: Dr. Hale's basic examine was so inadequate that he did not always do a rectal exam. Consequently, he not only misdiagnosed a prostate so enlarged that 1) he was forced to stop a surgery AFTER the patient had been cut open, BUT 2) he had NO knowlege that the enlarged prostate was cancerous!!! Then, when questioned several times by the patient and family, he claimed the tumor was NOT cancerous. His final outrage was to remove himself from the care of his long-standing patient. Patient did not learn he had cancer until several weeks later, from his internist, who read the hospital report. The final outcome, after months of treatment and suffering, was that the patient, an otherwise very healthy and active man, died from &quot;complications from prostate cancer&quot; in St. John's Riverdale Hospital, August, 2002.  	3	3	1	3 	Insurance:Medicare

71	1	Rather than switching to another dermatologist, when our health plan changed, I pay out of pocket to go to Dr. Hale.  She took care of a growth that three other dermos couldn't.  And she treats me as a person, not just a patient or another number. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

75	1	I really like this doctor. He is super accommodating, knowledgeable and competent. Plus he's really easy to talk to.  I just saw the review below.  He is a sweetheart, AND he's been very helpful! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
75	-1	I have no doubt that he is trying his best, which is more than I can say for many doctors.  He has no qualms about ordering as many blood tests as possible, especially because the testing center is on the bottom floor of the building.  He has never been on time (which I can live with), but he is willing to stay late, etc., to answer questions.  	2	2	2	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
75	1	Very Helpful and accomodating-and very knowledgable-I was truly impressed - and the medicine he provided worked wonders for me... I highly recommend Boyan --Cheers 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:CIGNA
75	-1	Too busy with himself, phone, e-mail, cold and indifferent. 	3	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
75	1	Dr Hadjiev is extremely competent and helpful - he conducted a thorough evaluation of my asthma and allergies and got me on a much better treatment plan. I have encountered few docors who offer this level of care.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
75	1	One of the best doctors I've been to - and I've seen many allergists! Dr. Hadjiev takes his time, listens to you and explains everything. He will work with you to find a treatment to suit your lifestyle & budget & personal preferences. Excellent bedside manner and very knowledgeable. He keeps up to date on the latest treatments & meds. I've already recommended him to some of my friends and co-workers, and they all had positive experiences with him. If only more doctors were this good... I hope he continues to practice for many years to come! 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
75	1	Dr. Hadjiev is extremely patient, thorough, always helpful--and above all personable. He is especially good with taking time to answer questions and explains why he is recommending/prescribing certain treatments. I am always confident that his advice is well-thought out and he gives personalized attention to each patient.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
75	1	He was about to leave for the day, but offered to stay and see me since I was not feeling well. He is young, personable, and very knowledgable; honestly cares about patients. I would highly recommend him to anyone. My wife will be going to him next week.  	 5/7/07		5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
76	-1	This Doctor was very arrogant, gave you no time, and was not very helpful.  His 5 minutes with you felt like a waste of time.  Didn't seemed concerned.  Read you his 5 same questions and gave you the next appt. 	4	3	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown
76	0	this doctor didnt listen to what i was telling him. Seemed to know more about how i was feeling than i did. I explained that something else was wrong and he didnt seem to listen. Had to get a new doctor and was then correctly diagnosed. Would not go back to him if he was the last doctor on earth 	4	4	3	3 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
76	1	Have been seeing this doctor for a couple years and he makes you very comfortable to talk to - seems very concerned with all health problems, even physical and seems to always remember everything discussed from previous visits. Has been very helpful and the staff is very lovely and prompt. Great practice... 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
77	-1	Receptionist are very unprofessional and unwilling to help their patients. Instead of tending to our health and concerns they are there yelling at us, patients. Never had I experienced such unprofessional group of staff especially in a medical office.  	1	1	1	2 	Insurance:Anthem
77	-1	after 3 months in pain, I had to seek a pain management doctor...Dr Haar never properly diagnosed me missing a herniated disc in the cervical spine as a neck sprain. When I went for a followup he was condescending and asked &quot;what more can I do for you&#63;' I was there to ask what my next steps of treatment should be (PT, neck collar, surgery, wait to heal-not one suggestion) Your lucky if you get to see him, iit's a factory of in/out patients often you see his PAs.   His office staff are excellent, kind and courteous-he is luck y to have a staff like this!! 	5	2	1	1 	Insurance:GHI
77	1	I have been a patient of Dr. Haar for over twenty years and have always experienced a pleasurable staff and quality care from him. I have had three surgeries performed by him with minimum to no scarring at all. I truly value and trust his medical judgement so much that i have sent plenty of my co-workers to him with the same results. I am truly satisfied with him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:GHI
77	1	I would like to just say that Dr. Haar is the most knowlegable, capable and courtieous surgeon I have ever met. He performed 2 separate shoulder surgeries within a year and half. Both with outstanding results. The staff was the most professional and caring doctors staff I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Thank you to Dr.  Haar and all his staff 	5	4	4	5 	Insurance:GHI
77	-1	I have never met such an unhelpful, rushed and rude doctor in my life. Not only did the man not even ask me how I injured my sprained ankle, he questioned if it even hurt when he couldn't specify immediately the location of the pain. He gave me about 2 minutes of his time and offered to give me heavy pain medication, again without even asking me what happened. After I objected saying something more was going on with my ankle he said &quot;We could get you some physical therapy. WOuld that make you feel better&#63;&quot; It was horribly condescending, as if he didn't have time for me because I wasn't one of his &quot;elite&quot; clients. I was very dissatisfied with my experience and canceled my follow up appointment.  	2	3	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
78	0	Poor bedside manner.  Seemed annoyed when we asked questions, and then, never quite answered them.  I thought she might have had an off day, but then heard the same from others. 	5	4	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown
78	1	 	2	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
79	1	I have been going to Dr Halle for many years and can tell you he is very friendly, compassionate and knowledgeable dentist. I have always been well treated by him as well as his staff, and he has always taken the time to address any questions I have had. He is also a perfectionist, which I love, because I can be very neurotic about the appearance of my teeth. I highly recommend Dr Halle. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
79	1	Love Dr. Halle.  Love the office.  Dr. Halle is the most caring, professional dentist I have ever used.  He takes time to make certain that every questions is answered and you are comfortable with the work being done. I would not go anywhere else. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
79	-1	His staff in the Brentwood office he shares with Richard Tesser are the very best!  Dr. Halle however is someone to avoid at all costs.  He gives poor advice and his communication with patients is worse.  Stay away with him and go to the Sr. partner.  I don't know how he stays in business 	5	4	2	2 	Insurance:Unknown
80	-1	Took plenty of time to get my history and did a very exhaustive and careful neurological exam. However, his letter to my other doctor was littered errors--18 in all.  And his &quot;diagnosis&quot; was so off the wall, it's comical! 	 6/21/12	3	3	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
80	-1	Dr Halperin is basically useless. I sent a letter to my ins company asking they do not pay him. He is extremely closed minded and actually wrote a book about lyme that he knows nothing about. One day someone is going to sock him with a big malpractice suit. He cost me months of suffering 	4	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
80	-1	Dr John Halperin happens to be the most condescending person that I've ever come into contact with.  He had absolutely no knowledge of Lyme disease, which is why I was referred to him in the first place.  After making me go through a sobriety test and flashing a light in my eyes, he diregarded any symptoms I had as 'in my head' and told me that all signs pointed to anxiety and depression.  This couldn't be further from the truth and two weeks on I still await my blood results 	5	3	1	1 	Insurance:Oxford
80	-1	This man is a victim of his own arrogance and ignorance. If Lyme is so easily cured, let him be infected, let it go untreated for several years, then see how well he is doing. He is not to be trusted, as he long ago lost any semblance of an open,curious mind. 	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
80	0	pleasant, referred me to the correct specialist.he was okay 	5	4	3	3 	Insurance:Unknown
80	-1	Dismissive and condescending. Without empathy or care. 	3	2	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
80	-1	I travelled from Canada to see this doctor, while he was still practicing on Long Island, NY. I suspected I might have Lyme disease. Was told by him that for all intents and puposes it was all in my head, that I was suffering from depression. Not long after, I found a Lyme-literate doctor who co-ordinated a test with the specialized tick-borne illness lab Igenex, and my results came back positive. I think unless you have had Lyme for 20+ years and have obvious lesions on the brain, this doctor will not be helpful in diagnosing. 		3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
81	1	Very kind and patient... colon cancer was found during routine colonoscopy... I was one of the lucky ones...  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
81	1	I had cancer of the colon.  Many nodes were involved.  This was 2002 and I have done very well since.  This guy is great.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
82	1	Wonderful doctor. Took the time, explained things, very helpful and kind. 	3	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
83	1	Dr. Halpern is a skin cancer expert and is very thorough with his exams. He's probably not the right person to go with cosmetic derm issues, but is top of the line for skin cancer concerns including annual check ups. 		4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
84	1	WOW, I am really surprised by some of comments written here. It was like they saw a different doctor. I have been seeing Dr. Haber for a few years now and am thrilled that I was lucky enough to find him. He listens to me and really hears what I have to say. He is a perfectionist in his care for me and never seems to miss a thing. Every visit he gives me the time needed go over everything and change or add what ever  I never care if he runs in or out  time because I know it is  to give the attention that he is giving me. I have many medical problems and before Dr. Haber I   could not seem to find a doctor who could manage to give me the time and care needed to help get me better. He treats the whole person!   with the care, attention and respect. He is worth any wait, interruptions, or a rare mistake on his staffs part. If you want old fashioned Dr. Care then he is the doctor for you.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Humana
84	1	Sometimes seems rushed but very attentive to your comments/complaints. Probably the most thorough and investigative physician I have been to.  	4	4	5	5 	Insurance:Oxford
84	1	I reviewed doctor haber already under infectious disease doctors, but when I saw the first review here I had to comment. Like the review immediately before me, I find the doctor knowledgeable and thorough - in fact I used these two words in the other comment I wrote before I read that the other reviewer also used them. He is also friendly but as you can surmise from the reviews, his office is busy. He does see many patients but he takes his time with me at least and I believe the other patients as well. The office can be busy so the staff may not take a lot of time to chitchat. Still, I find the first story to be difficult to credit - sounds like he's got the wrong doctor or misunderstood was was going on, or expected too much.  	4	4	5	4 	Insurance:Aetna
84	1	Dr. Haber is a knowledgeable and though physician, who has a keen attention to detail and an excellent memory. He is specialized in infectious diseases but has also served as my primary care point of reference for the last 3 years. He will take his time to answer all your questions and address any concerns you might have. From a follow up point of view, he sets the bar very high and I only wish I could receive the same from my other MDs I occasionally interact with. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the quality of his service.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
84	0	Pleasant office and staff. Very rushed, harried, over stressed physician - it's difficult to feel you're getting quality health care when the physician is bouncing in and out of the room doing half a dozen things at once.  	4	4	2	4 	Insurance:Oxford
84	1	I would have had to deal with all types of health issues if he were not so thorough in with his examinations. 	5	4	4	5 	Insurance:Unknown
84	0	Rushes around like a chicken withouut a head.  	4	4	3	3 	Insurance:Oxford
84	0	This was the first and probably only time I will be going to this doctor. He was 45 minutes late for the appt. and didn't even apologize. He didn't introduce himself even though it was my first time there. When I tried to explain why I thought I might be having knee pain, he interupted me several times. So he never did get the full story. Additionally, they did some blood tests since I was there for a check-up in addition to my knee issues. It turned out I had anemia. He left a message on my answering machine and when I called back to get a plan of action for fixing the problem - he completely ignored me wouldn't answer the call and put me on the phone with an assitant who said &quot;not to worry about it&quot;. Poor care all around and very unprofessional.  	2	1	1	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
85	1	There are not many (if any) doctors like Dr. Haliasos.  He is one of those rare doctors who genuinely cares about his patients. He is always accurate in his diagnosis, completely knowledgable and up-to-date, reassuring and comforting, and I trust him completely.  It is always a pleasant experience seeing him and Lily, no matter what the circumstances are.  They are truly good, caring people, and I feel fortunate to have been a patient for the past ten years. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
85	1	Dr. Haliasos runs a simple, uncomplicated practice and spends a great deal of time with each patient.  He is very knowledgeable about a wide variety of conditions and gives very good common sense advice.  Unlike a lot of doctors, he doesn't over-medicate and recommend tons of tests to scare you half to death.  If you have an urgent problem he will always find the time to accommodate you.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

87	1	Dr. Hainline has helped me recover from panic attacks after going to go seeral other doctors who could not solve my problem. He diagnosed me corectly after getting to the root cause and prescribed proper medication.  I have not had an attack for several years.I have great confidence and respect for him.  He is totally  available to answer my quesions via email.  He has even helped me find the right dr. for my husband's issues. He is caring and compassionate.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

87	0	Dr. Hainline was very aggressive in ordering tests once a demylenating lesion was seen, but when it was only one lesion, he seemed very uninterested in going any further. He was more than happy to prescribe meds for me, which i was grateful in dealing with the pain, however, he actually considered releasing me because he doesn't treat patients with single demylenating lesions.  Steroids over with and pain is back just as bad as before, and now I feel like I am bothering him and he doesn't know how to help me, I am very frustrated and sad by what took place with him.  I really liked him but now don't know what to do.  I wasn't sure if he was disappointed I sought a second opinion, but I had to as my life is not my own and a loved one asked me to, I concurred.  I shared this with Dr. Hainline, but maybe I shouldn;t have.  Oh well now I don't want to go back to him, because I think he really doesn't care and now I must seek other help.  I am so upset. I wish I could tell him, but can't 	5	5	2	3 	Insurance:Aetna
87	1	Dr. Hainline is an extraordinary and gifted doctor.  He reaches far from his specialty of Neurology and Pain Management and looks for a mind/body connection in helping his chronic pain patients.  He uses all modalities available through his practice to help the patient in their recovery process. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

89	-1	I went to Dr. Halpern with a severely separated shoulder because I heard he was the best. After a perfunctory check up where he spent less than 5 minutes with me, he sent me on my way and charged an exorbitant rate that I knew was not covered by insurance (so I can't blame him for that). I should have questioned it from the beginning, but I was so happy to hear I would just recover taking it easy that I didn't. When the shoulder did not heal properly 6 months later, I tried to make another appointment to have him do a proper evaluation, the evaluation I paid for initially. He performed another superficial evaluation and then, after providing no insight or suggestions beyond what I asked him about explicitly, he charged me another couple hundred dollars and when I tried to speak with him about it, he sent a letter discontinuing service and never even spoke with me. Bottom line, I am sure Dr. Halpern is highly capable, but he is far too busy to provide the patient care to justify the cost 	1	4	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
90	-1	Dr prescribed a drug that was supposed to be a tapered dose.  Prescribed it twice a day for seven days and that's it.  Too high a dose with no taper.  Severe side effects related to cutting off dosage, when questioned, denied the drug had anything to do with it.  Wound up in ER.   Very scary,  he only cares about $$ and has no real experience 	3	5	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
90	-1	he does not care about you just the almighty $$$. never in  room more than 5 min. you take test he never goes over the results with you.  good for the flu shot 	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
90	0	Mixed experience. While Dr. Brett was speedy on the office visit and diagnosed &amp; prescribed correctly, he was weak on follow-up questions - communicating only thru his monosyllabic staff vs. directly with the patient. It appeared that he was more concerned with cost efficiency than in patient care follow-up. I hope that Dr. Brett learns to spend more time with his patients vs. treating them like a financial transaction as this impacts patient satisfaction. 	 1/18/11	3	3	3	Insurance:Unknown
90	-1	It was the Jiffy Lube of doctor's. Good if you are in for an oil chaange, not good if you have apossible heart condition. I am male in my 40's and began experiencing issues with heart. I have been to many doctrs in the past for various bumos and bruises in my time in the military and seen it all. There is just something I didn't feel right about. The other servicemen like to go to him. Now I know why, he doesn't really diagnose you, he just writes you a doctors note for light duty and send you off. There is a reason he sees 60 patients a day..he is the Jiffy Lube of docs...in it to make a fast buck.  	4	3	1	1 	Insurance:Tricare

90	1	I see people saying, &quot;Oh 123 your in and out, he's too quick, doesn't pay attention&quot;... That's all just nonsense.  He is FAST PACED, yes.  But he DOES do his job. He asks the RIGHT questions. You get the RIGHT treatment.  People exaggerate about things. Father and son are both friendly and DO THEIR JOBS. Thank you guys for the help...my problem was solved and I am a happier person now.  I have my 2nd appointment today, I would recommend the Father Son duo to ANYONE!!!  If your appt is at 2pm you will GET IN @ 1:55pm or 2pm.  Never a wait...from my friends experience they've always gotten in EARLY, or AT THE TIME GIVEN.

90	0	Very Unprofessional. Does not do any actual doctor work himself. You just end up doing your own check up. &quot;Hi Doctor how are you&#63;&quot; &quot;Good, whats your problem&quot; &quot;Im not sure, havent been feeling well, I think I may have a throat infection&quot; &quot;Ok, heres your perscription, see you later&quot;. You are lucky if he actually checks you out at all. Unhelpful, will write scripts for no reason. Long story short, he just treats you as if you are an inconvenience to him, and you are wasting his time, no matter how serious your problem may be. Find another doctor if you are serious about your health.  	2	3	2	3 	Insurance:Tricare

I went in for a full physical and it was not like the 5 minute physicals I usually have. He checked my heart, sugar level, blood pressure, took blood sample, weight, etc. I was then taken into another room by another really nice staff to take some scans and check my thyroid, kidneys,uterus, etc. I was in and out of there in about 40mins.

Dr. Haider's office is beautiful not to mention very modern, clean, easily accessible, and has a friendly staff. Dr. Haider is an exceptional doctor and I highly recommend him.

95	-1	First and foremost Dr. Hagopian pulled a NO-SHOW for my surgery.  In my first visit with him, he saw me 2 hours late. During that visit, he scheduled me for surgery for the following month. After repeated phone calls to his various offices, he finally returned my call, the DAY BEFORE SURGERY. On the day of surgery, I sat, in a hospital gown, along with the entire operating room staff, (Anesthesiologist, Resident Assistant, and Head Nurse) WAITING FOR 3 HOURS. In preparation for surgery, I was not allowed to eat after midnight. So at that point it had been 24 hours since I'd had anything to eat or drink. I finally got up and left. As my parents were practically carrying me to the car, he walked in. His excuse was that he got caught up in routine office visits with patients. So it wasn't like he was held up by an emergency. This guy is a gyno-oncologist. I wonder how much my condition has worsened since my &quot;missed&quot; operation. I'm filing numerous complains with every agency I can. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
96	1	Dr. Hall is a genuinely concerned, thoughtful, and compassionate doctor.  I saw her many times over the course of four years, and she always proved extremely knowledgeable and willing to talk through different courses of action until we found something we were both comfortable with.  She thinks of her patients as people, listens well, and genuinely cares about their overall health, rather than simply diagnosing a problem or condition.  I was always astonished by how much she remembered about my health and history even after not seeing her for six months.  A genuinely excellent doctor and person.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
97	-1	he might be ok for a rash or botox, but I had a serious problem and he was unable to help me.  He tried but failed miserably and didn't have the honesty to send me to someone else.  	3	5	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
97	1	So what if his social skills are lacking...If you really want someone one knows what he's doing and is extremely intelligent, that's Dr. Halperin. Really knows his stuff and will stop at nothing to figure out what's going on...  	5	2	4	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
97	-1	Rude, late and rushed me through my appointment.  I would advise finding a different doctor.  	3	1	1	1 	Insurance:HIP
97	-1	Absolutely no personality and was not very helpful.  I just learned about this website and I wish I looked at his reviews before going to see him!   I called after my visit to ask the doctor a question.  I've called 10 times and he hasn't called back and I haven't been able to get him on the phone.   Needless to say, I am going to find a new dermatologist.   Beware! 	2	3	1	1 	Insurance:Oxford
97	1	He is very knowledgable but a bit weird....I had this skin issue for years and in 10 days it was gone.. HE PERSERVED MY SEXY!!!!! 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
97	1	I had a skin condition that had plagued me for more than 25 years.  Dermatologists at NY Hosp/Cornell, NY Mt Sinai, Tufts U and Mass General all could not find a solution. Dr Halperin's diagnosis was the first correct one and solved the problem after 2 mos treatment. Fabulous!  FYI, I was referred to him by very well regarded dermatological surgeon who is a professor at NY Cornell. 	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
97	0	Miserable bedside manner and the typical wait is more than an hour. He's a smart guy but such a flake.  		1	2	4 	Insurance:Oxford
97	-1	Worst doctor ever! He put my life and my baby's life in danger. I went to see him because of a blister on my chest. In order to diagnose it, he took my skin sample. But he took it without sterilization and left the wound open after the procedure. It caused cellulitis in 2 days! I was 7 month pregnant at the time and was hospitalized for a week.  		3	1	1 	Insurance:United Healthcare
98	-1	1.surgically removed a front tooth and took a lot of bone out too.Left a mess of stitches going in every different direction 2.did a Buccal bone implant that was not used and unnescessary 3. did a sinus lift that was ineffective and cannot be utilized. The healed bone is a weird looking patchwork. Other dentists on seeing this and asked if a sinus lift was done commented that &quot;Something&quot; was done (but they wouldn't call it a sinus lift)4.Other bone grafts were done all of which were not useful.5.two implants were done to replace front teeth. without telling me exactly what she was doing, but only saying they were &quot;going to be placed a little differently&quot; (would not say more-no consent)put the implants behind the gumline.they are now a constant source of discomfort(like something is stuck to the roof of your mouth)and neccessitate long curved crowns, difficult to get right, speech affected. Further the abutments and the crowns separated in only a couple of months. 	4	4	1	3 	Insurance:Unknown
