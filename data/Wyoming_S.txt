1	-1	 First visit : Doctor answered his cell phone and talked to his wife about a family issue while I was naked and he was doing my pap smear. I had some girl issues and he tried to give me Zoloft and tell me I was depressed so I again reiterated what my issue was and he said no your just depressed.  LOL The whole appointment was pretty much a waste of money and I felt violated after the cell phone call and tacky conversation : F- 	1	2	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
1	1	commentsDr. Scott is very patient, kind, and listens to his clients. I have had two 100% Natural child births with him and he's been wonderful with us. He is respectful of laboring mothers and also supportive of breastfeeding. He has done everything we asked and was willing to discuss our birth plan and questions we had. He is laid-back and practical. We simply love him! 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

14	1	commentsShe is very very compassionate, spends quality time...that why you usually wait, but it is worth it. Paid/Co-pay:$65	4	1	5	4	Insurance:Unknown
14	1	commentsShe is by far the best doctor I've ever been to.  She really listens and cares.  She will run any test you feel you may need just for your own peace of mind.  She doesn't have a &quot;greater than thou&quot; attitude but talks to you like a caring friend.  Unfortunately her nurse doesn't always get back the first time you call. 	2	3	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
14	1	 Excellent doctor. I have numerous medical issues and she is the first doctor who has taken the time to really listen and when she can't adequately address a specific issue, she gets me to the specialists I've needed. She sometimes runs behind; however, I know that she will take all the time she needs to address all of my issues. (And I usually have quite a list!) She doesn't make you feel rushed. This makes it well worth the wait because you know you matter to her. She even stops to ask about my health when I bring my daughter to her since we are both patients, and she knows I struggle with my health. I would highly recommend this doctor to anyone looking for a new doctor.  	4	3	5	5	Insurance:Medicare
14	1	 She is the best doctor I have ever had.  She takes the time to listen to you and you know you have her full attention and it is very obvious that she cares about her patients.  I had a very tramatic child birth and if I would have had any other doctor I don't think I would of pulled through as well as I did.  She's great.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Coventry

16	1	commentsBeen to a lot of chiropractors in my lifetime. Dr. Simpson is far above and beyond others I have seen. I appreciate his service to the community. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
20	1	commentsKnowlegable, experienced, and while very friendly and kind, he's also a no BS kind of guy. He always has time to answer questions. As an RN, I trust his care and follow through to several of my family members. Paid/Co-pay:$100	3	3	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
20	-1	 I USED TO LOVE GOING TO DR BEFORE HE JOINED WESTERN MEDICAL. TOO BUSY, STAFF RUDE AND ALL YOU EVER GET IS VOICEMAIL. YOU FEEL LIKE A NUMBER, THEY DON'T CALL U BACK, DR ALWAYS CHEERFUL, BUT JUST SIMPLY OVERWORKED. WILL NOT DO OTHER TEST, LIKE PAPSMEAR, WANTS TO DEAL WITH OTHER ILLNESS FIRST. YOU GET BILLED SOMETIMES  2 YRS AFTER THE VISIT (BY THAT TIME ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS DONE TO YOU. BLOODTESTS ARE INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED. I WAS WAITING FOR A TESTRESULT AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD GET BACK WITH ME IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 3 WEEKS WENT BY AND NO CALL- CALLED THE OFFICE AND THE LADY ANSWERING THE PHONE GOT RUDE AND SAID THAT PATIENTS WOULD ONLY BE NOTIFIED IF THERE WHERE BAD RESULTS, WHEN I TOLD HER WHAT TEST WAS DONE SHE BECAME QUIET AND I TALKED TO HIS ASSISTANT. IT IS SUCH A SHAME, I REALLY USED TO LOVE THIS DR. I LEFT HIS PRACTICE FOR ANOTHER DR IN TOWN 2 YRS AGO AND COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.  	1	1	1	3	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

48	-1	 Quick to diagnose patients as depressed. I was told my breathing problems were in my head that I should go to school. Next day I was flown out of the er with pulmonary embolus and blood clots. If I'd have listened to her I'd be dead.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
48	0	 She has a very snooty,  impersonal, dry personality that comes across condescending. She is not friendly, but did what was needed. The staff did not deal well with my child having shot anxiety. In this officeand no one gives direction on anything, you have to repeatedly ask.  	4	3	3	3	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
54	-1	commentsIf you're looking for an MS diagnosis, this is the place to go. He misdiagnosed me and I've talked with others that he did the same thing to. Big money in MS. His treatment caused likely permanent damage in me. I haven't had a day without pain since crossing his path. 	1	3	1	1	Insurance:Unknown

100	1	commentsI have seen Dr. Segal for over 3 years now.  He has found solutions to medical problems when other drs have failed me.  I also happen to know the person above.  Simply put, she is a psychotic **** 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
100	-1	 HE DID A FOLLOWUP WITH MY SON IN THE HOSPITAL HAVING NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE AND IN FIVE MINUTES DECIDED HE WANTED TO DISCHARGE HIM.  HE MADE THIS DECISION ONLY TWO HOURS AFTER A CENTRAL LINE HAD BEEN DONE ON MY SON.  THE NURSING STAFF WAS AS OUTRAGED AS WE WERE AND BACKED US IN IMMEDIATELY REMOVING HIM FROM SEEING OUR SON.  HE WAS A NEW DOCTOR WITH OUR EXISTING DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WAS NO LONGER WITH THAT OFFICE.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Medicare
