2	1	He was very helpful and I felt confident that he was a very competent doctor. Thanks to him, I recovered in a short time with a small scar and was able to continue playing soccer.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
2	1	Dr X performed my left ACL replacement surgery. I've been very happy with the results. He made me feel comfortable and explained everything well so that I felt good about the procedure. I would recommend his services to anyone considering the same procedure.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
2	1	Dr. X is a craftsman of the skeleton. He repaired my shattered clavicle and had me up and running within weeks of surgery. He is very personable, and thoroughly explained my injury and my options. I gave the staff a 4 rating because I was billed repeatedly for visits I'd already paid for and for an item that the insurer had negotiated as non-payable. A phone call and letter took care of that, but I might have overpaid had I not tracked my payments with a spreadsheet. Overall, however, the service was fine, and I would return to Dr. X without hesitation if injured again.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna
