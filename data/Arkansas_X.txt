2	1	 Dr. Xaysanasy and his staff are very caring people.  My father is a diabetic with multiple wounds.  He was at risk for amputation and have seen two other podiatrist for his foot. Dr. Xaysanasy does take his time to treat my wounds and has saved my father's foot from being amputated.  Yes, he has a minor OR in his office where he does surgery and has offered sedation to my father when needed and has left it up to him to decide.  He wouldn't consider surgery without the option of being comfortable and if he or I felt unsafe, we would have not returned.  He has a given my father a new lease on life.  Everyone should read about diabetes and amputation.  Not everyone can be saved and not everyone will have a good outcome.  Dr. Xaysanasy and his staff never promised us that everything will be good and that we would have no problems.  What he did offer is hope which we did not have prior to being a patient.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
