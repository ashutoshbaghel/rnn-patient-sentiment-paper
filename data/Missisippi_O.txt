18	1	 We need more physicians like Dr. Ostrander. He is knowledgeable and caring.  I drive over 20 min to see him.  	4	4	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
40	-1	commentshorrible,horrible man! rude,obnoxious, does not relate well to his patients, only in it for the money. needs to retire. 	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
55	-1	 Office is only open 2 days per week and the doctor is often not there those days or has to unexpectedly cancel.  Wait time for an appointment is often 2 to 3 weeks.  Dr. Orme himself is very nice and professional, but was educated outside the USA and seems to be lacking a little of the knowledge of other doctors.  My major complaint is that he never remembers any of my last visits, so establishing any type of medical relationship and/or history with him is probably out of the question.  	4	2	2	2	Insurance:Tricare
