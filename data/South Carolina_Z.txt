7	1	 If you want a Dr. who prevents problems from arising, as well as one who treats with skill and compassion those problems that do arise, she's your girl. Very speedy, punctual appointments, but spends all the time you need to discuss your issues and answer your questions.  		5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

15	-1	.  very arrogant, had to consult with nurse before making a diagnosis,his treatments did not help 	3	3	1	1	Insurance:Tricare
23	-1	 This doctor gives one word answers to queries about test results. When I was sent to Urgent Care after hours by the on-call Doctor for the practice, neither Dr.zwerner nor his staff called to follow-up. Since I couldn't get anything but one word answers, I obtained his notes about my visit and they claimed everything was normal even though I reported severe pain and the EKG was so abnormal he made the techs do it again because he thought they did it wrong (second result was the same as the first) and he then ordered extensive tests without any explanation of what the tests were looking for or why. I cannot recommend this doctor to anyone.  	4	4	1	3	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

39	-1	 I went in for Leg Cramps. This Dr gave me a prescription that has been banned since 2006. Then he called in a drug that helps chest pain and high blood pressure for me. Which I do not have chest pains or high blood pressure. That could have killed me. The worst ever. I dont trust him or his practice.  	2	1	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
