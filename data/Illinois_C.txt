5	1	 Dr. Cahill and staff are wonderful.  My insurance covered my gastric bypass, and the entire staff goes above and beyond to make you feel safe and comfortable.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
11	1	 Excellent doctor, but at times difficult to get convenient office appt, but once able to see him, he spends a lot of time with you and is extremely thorough, answers all my questions & goes above and beyond that which most doctors do.  Excellent bedside manner. Very ethical & well trained. Has strong Christian family values.  Definitely worth the wait to see him!!! Also has excellent partners that we are able to see ASAP for emergencies etc. when he is over booked.  	5	4	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

25	-1	 Dr. Cahan is very unprofessional and impatient. I took my daughter to see him at least three times.  He's never nice and always in a rush to finish.  I can never get all my questions answered.  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:HumanaPaid/Co-pay:$1000

58	-1	 I recently had to switch dentists because my previous dentist was no longer accepting my insurance.  Today was my first visit with this dentist, she was not friendly at all and her service was very poor I had to tell her to place the suction in my son's mouth because he was swallowing all the flouride during a cleaning, I was really upset, plus the machine she was using to apply the blue paste unto my son's teeth did not work properly.  I have never experienced this before in my life, I would really hate for other people to see this person.  I do not recommend this dentist to anyone.  	1	5	1	1	Insurance:United Healthcare
62	1	commentsI love Shanie!!! She's awesome! She provided me with the first relief I had found in over five years, and she has my dog in tip top shape. Wheather you are human or animal, if Shanie puts you in your in and you stay in without any problems! Unlike many other chiropratctors I have seen who give you an adjustment, but only move it part way so you have to continually come back and spend more money. I highly recommend Shanie to anyone male/ female human or animal. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
62	1	commentsDr. Cahill is an awesome chiropractor! My dog (they need natural healthcare too) also loves to receive her expertise and compassionate care. 		5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
62	1	commentsShanie is terrific--she really works with your body and knows her stuff like no one I've seen. She is a little more touchy-feely than I am, but she is so knowledgable that I'm open to it. 		5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

67	1	 Very good doctor. Takes his time and has the knowledge. Wait time is long and so are getting appts. But I am pleased with this man. Have gone to him for 4 years now and recommend him highly.  	4	2	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
68	0	 Doctor refused to do my child's physical and left the exam room after 15 seconds because my child's birthday wasn't until next week. Doctor proceeded to write lies on my disabled childs medical records after I decided leave the practice because of the way my child and I were treated by this pediatrician. I am totally dumbfounded on the way my child and I were treated after going to this practice for over ten years.  	3	4	2	3	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

88	-1	 Was seen by her at least two times a week for two months.  My lab tests were never organized, just shoved into my file.  She tested me for the SAME STD three times, and I had KIDNEY FAILURE!  This she never figured out, yet the next doctor took approx 10 minutes to diagnose me.   AWFUL!!!!! 	4	4	1	1	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
