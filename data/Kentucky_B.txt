1	1	He was a OBGYN when I saw him. He delivered all three of my childrena nd saved my son's life. Wonderful caring man. My son is named after him.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal
1	1	He was a practicing OB/GYN when he was my doctor. A genuinely good, honest Christian man who goes the extra mile to make sure you get top-notch care. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
2	1	Always interested in the patient; if he doesn't know something, he's willing and eager to do the necessary research. Follows up as promised.  	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Humana
3	-1	Don't go to this doctor, he will not answer patients phone calls and does not take proper care of his patients. My mother has liver cancer now and can not feel her legs, he prescribed medicine for her, it made her legs swell which put her in excruciating pain, he will not come to the hospital to check on her because he says its not the medicine when the pharmacist said that was a known side effect and she had to contact  doctor if it happened 	5	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
3	1	Dr. Ballou is wonderful, he allows family in with his patients so that he everyone is on the same page, which is very helpful. Very friendly as well! 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
3	1	Dr. Ballou is a fabulous doctor. We are blessed to have someone like him in such a small town! 		5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
3	-1	He would not remove both breasts from my sister, only the cancerous breast even though our mom, 2 other sisters, our grandmother, a maternal first cousin, and 2 maternal great aunts have all had breast cancer and some have died as a result of it before the age of 55! Now she has to live with the constant worry that it may show up in the other breast. He doesn't seem to think she should get the brca test either. He has not suggested a colonoscopy to her when there is a direct link between the two types of cancers(not to mention we had an aunt die at the age of 43 from colon cancer!). I think his medical knowledge of preventative medicine dates back to the dark ages! 		3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
3	-1	HE TOLD MY BROTHER IN LAW TO GO HOME AND START FISHING . HE DIDN'T HAVE CANCER ANYMORE. IN TWO WEEKS HE WAS DEAD.THIS WAS LUNG CANCER. 		1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
4	1	One of the better doctors I've seen for sure.  Seemed quite knowledgeable, and a nice guy as well.  My only disappointment is that the skin condition I have, my insurance would not cover, so I was basically &quot;on my own&quot; with it.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Humana
5	-1	She was incompetent at her job and insulted me! I never came back to her office after the initial visit! 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
6	1	He is the best. SECOND TO NONE. He found what the other doctors didnt bother to look for. He stand by the oath he took as a doctor. The other doctors seem to have forgotten. They are in it for money. Hes in it to heal people 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
6	-1	I can't believe they invited this guy to be staff at the KK hand clinic. He seemed completely incompetent and down right stupid, and doesn't speak English. Claims to be surgeon, but cannot diagnose obvious soft tissue injuries on an MRI and can't make any real diagnosis. Claimed my ligament tears were psychiatric.  Are you kidding me&#63; 	3	3	1	1 	Insurance:CIGNA
7	1	one man show, so it may take time to get in.  But, he's top notch.  and very good in his field! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Anthem

10	-1	Dr. Banahan is a rip off. She wanted to do $6000. Worth of dental work on my 5 year old. I took him to another dentist for a second opinion and they said he needed one cavity between his teeth taken care of.  I had already been questioning the practice because of the amount of work my kids had already had done and this was the final straw. Dr bananhan also always seemed anoyed. She was alrigt with kids but disnt seem to love her job.   We are so happy at our new practice where there are 3 dentists who are grey with kids and passionate about their jobs! 	3	2	1	1 	Insurance:Aetna
10	1	Dr. Jackie is great! She does a great job with my kids and she is always very professional. The staff and hygienists are also very good and very helpful. Highly recommend! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
11	0	Had to wait long periods of time for scheduled appointments.  Coded matters incorrectly so insurance company won't pay.  Very poor staff attitudes.  	1	1	3	3 	Insurance:United Healthcare
11	1	One of the best doctors I have ever had.  Very easy to talk to and will go the extra mile for you.  I would recommend her to anyone who needs to change doctors.  MY visits with Dr.Barret are always pleasant andd informative.  I just can't say enough about her.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
11	1	I have had Dr. Barrett as my doctor for over 8 years now and she is by far one of the best docs out there.  I like the fact that she is straight with you and knows what is best for you as a patient.  A doctor patient relationship takes more than one appointment to be formed.  She has always been great for me and my husband.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
11	-1	Dr. Barrett is unkind, unknowledgeable(IMO) and has a huge ego.I went to her because I had alot of body pain and mild depression. Without much thought she prescribed an antidepressant.I went home and did some research online.I read alot of bad reviews on the drug and decided not to take it.She called me a week later to ask how I was doing on the drug(I thought at the time that was very nice)however when I told her I decided not to take it because of what I read she got very defensive.I told her I read that it was a hard drug to get off of and she said &quot;not the way I have you get off of it&quot; then went on to say &quot;I really wish people wouldn't use the internet to get information on drugs because they only read the bad things.&quot;She ended the conversation with &quot;Well you must not be feeling too bad because if you did you would want to try something so call me when you decide you want something.&quot; I was in shock! I have since heard of others with the same complaint about her. 	2	4	1	2 	Insurance:Unknown
12	0	I have a severe auto immune conditions called polymysitis and have been seeing him regularly for three years.  When it flared up I went to his office and he refused to see me.  I was forced to go to the ER where the treatment was not effective.  They sent me home and 2 weeks later I had to be admitted to the hospital with a much worse condition.  As a result of his irresponsibility my overall condition has deteriorted considerably.  He did not help me when I needed him.  	1	4	2	3 	Insurance:Humana
12	-1	MISDIAGNOSED me. BEWARE. Handed me tissue and said I had ~10 years to live cuz I &quot;had Hep C from sharing dirty needles with drug addicts.&quot; (NOT true)Fam med doc proved I did NOT have hep C. Bad dr's nurse drew blood with needle going into arm sideways; didn't know what she was doing. HATE THAT PLACE! And he NEVER apologized.  	2	4	2	1 	Insurance:Anthem
12	1	Dr. Beers is a great Rheumatologist (which deals with more than just arthritis). He listens to what you have to say. He is very down-to-earth and easy to talk to. He is very caring, intelligent, and friendly. He never makes me feel rushed.  Also, if I ever have to leave a message with the staff about medication, or any other issues I may have, he is always quick to call me back. I know that with Dr. William H.  Beers as my Doctor, I am in good hands! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Medicaid / Medi-Cal

17	1	I had an arthrosopic repair of my knee after dislocating and damaging my patella playing B-ball. As a surgeon he did a great job. My knee healed very quickly after the procedure and is perfectly fine now. He was late to one follow-up appointment and seemed a bit rushed to interpret and explain the results of the procedure upon his arrival. Overall, he seems like a very competent doctor.  	3	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
17	1	I had rotator cuff repair done on 11-13. The staff was very helpful and the surgery went off without a hitch. My recovery has been remarkable. It is now 1-2-07 and my arm is at about 80%.I would recomend this surgeon for shoulder problems 		4	4	5 	Insurance:Unknown
17	1	He uses doctor asisstants (PAc's) but he was always near by and made a personal visit while i was there. He had temper problem by throwing my MRIs on the floor. but all in all very good doctor and i would suggest him to anyone who has a joint problem. Im currently going to have him work on my right knee (surgically) and he has THROUGHLY explained everything and if i have questions its just a phone call away for my answers. though he has a temper problem with his staff, he knows his stuff and i trust my knee with him. 		4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
18	1	I had a front tooth attached to a bridge break off.  Dr. Barrett got me in immediately glued the tooth back himself, and advised me not to bite into harder than a tuna sandwich.  He said it should hold for a short time until I could get in with a dentist for an implant.  That was 14 months ago.  Dr. Barret is kind, professional and he is a first rate dentist. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

20	1	Dr. Bark is wonderful! I had a severe case of plantar warts, one of the worst he had ever seen!, and he tried multiple treatments until they were finally gone! He is thorough, kind, patient, and by far the most educated dermatologist around! 	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
21	1	Young enough to know current issues yet experienced enough to know what he's doing. Relates well to children and parents.  My sons love him. I enjoy out visits because I feel like he listens to me and my concerns. Highly recommended.  	2	2	5	5 	Insurance:Anthem

22	-1	I had a eye surgery few years back. Past 1 week this eye is being irritated. I tried to get a reference doc in out of state since the irritation started. Every day atleast 4-5 calls to to his office(s) to get hold of Dr.Charles BArr, but his office staff is not at all helpful in provide a reference doctor in Chicago promptly. They cant direct my calls so that I can talk to him nor there is an email address to report to. Can't drive/fly to Louisville to have my eye checked as these cost will not be covered under my insurance. Every time I call to his office for an update on reference doc info, the staff has only 1 answer, Dr is is with a patient and when he gets to his office desk, he will be able to provide the info that I need. When does he get to his office  and how does he know that I'm waiting for a reply from him&#63; how do  Iknow how serious is my eye irritaion to get immediate attention.They don't care to provide the requested reference doc info in my area. 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown

24	1	Best doctor i have ever seen for my children. Recommend to everyone, very personal and polite kids love him.  and very informative, nice to see a dr that finally cares for the children rather than the money 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Anthem
24	-1	Baker is the worst dr I have ever seen. He has no concern or  patience with the child. I wonder how he is able to secure his job with his lack of knowledge. You will fell very pathetic if he is your ped because he is short tempered and want to lecture you to make you realize you are ingnorant and that he knows everything in this world.  	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Aetna
24	-1	OMG! I cannot believe this Dr. Baker...he is a jerk and an idiot!!! He is so rude and ignorant. I cannot believe he told another patient to feed their sick child fatty french fries because that is exactly what he told me...&quot;Give him chicken nuggets and fries&quot; What kind of &quot;doctor&quot; tells you to eat fatty foods when you are sick or even when you are healthy&#63; He has the worst bedside manner and should be working in a funeral home and not a pediatrician's office. I hold Graves Gilbert fires his dumb @$$.  	2	2	1	1 	Insurance:Anthem
24	-1	Wow, where do I start&#63; This man is a jerk, he is rude and hateful, he doesn't have a caring bone in his body, and he likes to spout off big words to make himself look smart, when in fact he doesn't have a clue. He was not gentle with my child and couldn't have been more hateful to me.  When my child started to cry while being examined, he picked him up and thrust him back to me, saying, &quot; Well, if you are going to cry, just go back to your mommma.&quot; At this point, I mistakenly asked a simple question about my son's shots, and he went into a 10 minute speech, where he barely took a breath, on how he would never delay or allow his patients to get off schedule with their shots because he didn't want to jeapordize his patients or his own children by having them be a part of a society that wasn't vaccinated. He then told me that if I didn't agree, I should make an appointment with another doc. I am going to do just that, asap. We won't ever see him again.  	4	3	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
24	-1	This Dr is a JERK! He was so ill mannered and rude to my 1 year old little girl that I was speechless. My child went to touch his stethoscope like most infants/toddlers would, and he yelled at her and was very cold telling her &quot;do not touch this&quot; while pointing his finger at her!!! He refused to hear my concerns about my child and then told me to feed my child with diarrhea greasy fatty french fries and junk food to help her bowels get solid...WTH&#63;&#63;&#63; He is even dumber than he looked..we only saw him once and then ran like hell!!! He acted as though he cared less about my child and that was very heart-breaking.  	3	2	1	1 	Insurance:Aetna
25	1	Excellent care from a skilled therapist.  Would return if needed.  Really saved my marriage and helped my depression. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

27	1	Dr. Beard has completed two knee surgeries for me.  The first one was in 1993 ACL along with meniscus, and the second was meniscus only.  He has been excellent both times.  He spent more than 30 minutes on the phone with me explaining my results and what needed to be done. He allowed me to ask all the questions I needed and never once made me feel like I was being rushed.  His bedside manner is excellent and he is so very nice.  He staff helped me navigate workers comp for the second injury, and although they could have a bit more personality, they helped me tremendously.  I am very pleased with the service and operation, and will not see any other orthopaedic specialist besides Dr. Beard.  	3	5	5	5 	Insurance:Workers Comp
27	1	Genuine doctor.  Good bedside manners. Very helpful, not pushy, and strives to ensure the best for his patients. He has done knee surgery for my mother-in-law, daughter and myself.  I highly recommend Dr. Beard. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
27	1	Dr. Beard is a great Doctor and a good man.  He helped me when none would.  I've had both my hips replaced by him and he's done an excellent job for me.   Larry Gore 	3	3	4	5 	Insurance:Medicare
27	1	I had knee surgery on Feb 21,2008 I feel he was understanding about my feelings.and the timing he let me pick the day and time that fitted me best.He didn't push me in to having my surgery.He let me make the choice of having it done.I would tell my friends and family about him.He's honest with you.Thats what I like in a doctor.  	4	3	4	4 	Insurance:Workers Comp
27	0	Knee replacement surgery was performed by Dr. Craig Beard. Resulting in an artery being cut in my leg. It bled into my lower leg which caused compartment syndrome. I almost lost my leg. They were ready to amputate my leg. Me and my family decided to go to another hospital for treatment in another city. My leg was saved after many surgery's, however I am left with no feeling in my foot and a problem known as &quot;drop foot&quot; where I am unable to move my ankle and foot, it drops down and I can not raise it up.  I can still walk but with great difficulty. Just the facts. 	4	2	1	4 	Insurance:Unknown

29	-1	 	1	1	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
30	-1	I am very upset with this doctor. I don't blame on a doctor for my wife's miscarriage.  She was 12 wks into the pregnancy when it happended.  We went for our checkup at wk 9, Dr. Bell said she's confident that our baby was still growing.  My wife had a feeling that something was wrong &amp; pointed out that she felt something different in the past few days, indicating she thinks the baby stopped growing.  Dr Bell says she was confident the baby is growing just by feeling her stomach.  At week 12, the miscarriage happened.  We went to the ER and she went through a great deal of pain.  We had an ultrasound and the results confirmed that the baby's size was around 7 wks.  That means the baby stopped growing before we saw Dr. Bell. If Dr. Bell took her job seriously and did an ultrasound for my wife, she could have removed the clots and tissue right way &amp; my wife would not have gone through so much pain.  In addition, Dr. Bell tried selling us some vitamins which I'm sure she makes commission.  	2	3	1	2 	Insurance:Aetna
30	1	Dr. Bell is a fabulous doctor. She is knowledgeable, warm, caring and makes you feel very comfortable.  The office she is with is very busy, but she is well worth the wait! 	 3/28/07		4	5	Insurance:Humana

43	1	Dr. Babcock removed all of my upper teeth due to life threatening infections. He also removed 4 extra large cysts that had grown into the sinus cavity. He then performed an open sinus lift and put in place 8 implants. Dr. Babcock is highly skilled, extremely knowledgeable, professional, and down to earth. He is one of the most enthusiastic doctors I have ever known.  He gladly answered all my questions thoroughly, and explained everything he was going to do during the procedure. Dr. Babcock cares about his patients.  He treated me with a great respect and he spoke to me on his level. He has an outstanding staff who are an excellent reflection of him. I am not disclosing the cost as this as it was not cheap and insurance companies pay little or nothing, but Dr. Babcock made this surgery affordable for me and I found his prices far more reasonable than others with less training and experience. I plan to have him do more implants down the road. This is a first class best ever surgeon.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

49	1	Dr. Beiting is an incredible gynecologist. She is passionate about women's health and wants to ensure that her patients feel empowered and confident. Their waiting rooms are comfortable and cozy, and the exam rooms are the same. Instead of a paper dress, you are given a robe and cotton sheets. Patients change clothes in a bathroom adjacent to the exam room. It doesn't feel like a typical exam, but instead a very comfortable and warm space.  	4	5	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

49	-1	I had a horrible experience with this doctor.  After considerable trouble to get her my medical records from another state, she announced she &quot;hadn't reviewed them&quot; and actually handed them back to me.

It's a shame when you take hours out of your schedule to try to address a serious problem and are treated in this way.  	1	2	1	2 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

51	-1	I am writing this review to inform those thinking about this dentist to please choose another! Dr. Barth does not does not take pride in her work and does not do a thorough job. Her cleanings take 5 minutes and fillings take 15. I've had 3 fillings done by her, all of which caused me pain and problems. The last filling I had done Dr. Barth said she couldn't find &quot;anything wrong with.&quot; After going to another dentist, I found out that there is damage to the nerve (clearly visible on the xray) and I'm going to now need a root canal. The cause of the damage was due to either not enough water used with the drilling tool or drilling too deep and damaging the nerve. I can't believe the nightmare I am going through because of this dentist. Unfortunately it's too late for me but I'm hoping to save someone else a disastrous experience. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. You'll be glad you did!! 	3	3	2	1 	Insurance:Unknown

52	1	I have always found Dr. Bennett to be a good, caring doctor.  I have been seeing her now for almost 6 years and have not had any complaints.  She takes the necessary steps to test and try to diagnose. If something is out of her expertise, she refers you right away. I don't think one could ask for more.  I would and do recommend her.  	4	4	5	4 	Insurance:Humana
52	1	Dr. Bennett is a good doctor. She's very friendly and is not afraid to tell you like it is (she told me I needed to lose weight). She told me about her own health experiences and gave good advice about what to do. She spends as much time with you as needed. If you ask a question she'll make sure you understand what she tells you. The wait time is average. I don't find it to be all that long before I am seen.  	4	3	5	5 	Insurance:Anthem
52	1	Dr Bennett has been my GP for over 7 years.  I find her direcvtness and hometown humor to be quite pleasant after dealing with the medical community of Washington, DC for almost 12 years.  I travel 35 miles for office visits, and usually have to wait until well past my scheduled appointment.   WHY you may ask&#63;  Simple, she is worth it!!!  She is a doctor who cares, takes the time to listen and talk with her patients, and takes your health almost personally!!! 	5	3	5	5 	Insurance:Tricare
52	0	If you are looking for a Doctor who will berate you and make you as uncomfortable as possible, Dr. Bennett is your gal. I've always had excellent service from all of the Doctors and ARNP's at PrimeCare, but she bordered on hateful. I can certainly understand if she was having a bad day, because we all do... but she was downright mean the entire time we spoke.  	1	5	1	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

I had one of the worst cases of Acid Reflux the doctor had ever seen and I use to have the prettiest smile and in a few months it took it away from me. I was so depressed because use to people loved to see me smile and I was to ashamed to open my mouth after the acid started taking it's toll on my beautiful teeth. Well after I got good dental insurance I went to Dr.Baker showed him my pictures from before and he said no problem and went to work on them. I have to admit I never dreamed I would see them again and walk around smiling from ear to ear but, I am! He gave me the confidence I use to have back! I promise go to him and his staff and you won't regret it. I'm actually excited about going to work and SMILING like they use to see me do.

The reason we go to see a pediatrician is to come away with the comfort of knowing that our child is well or what the illness is.  We came away with neither and she created further worries.

64	0	There are several reasons why I will not be going back to this doctor. I showed up on time for a 5:30 appointment, and she didn't take me until 7:00. Then she filed the appointment incorrectly with my insurance company, and when I disputed it she tried to convince me that it was my fault. Also, she may call at any and all hours of the day or night; I once called her in the afternoon and she called me back after 10PM when I was already in bed. I originally chose her because I work until 5:00 and she had later hours, but the bad experience I've had with her was not worth it. Overall, she is a nice person (aside from blaming me for her mistake with the insurance), but I do not want her as my doctor. 	3	1	2	3 	Insurance:Unknown

In addition, she is a bad listener: she asks you a question and then forgets your answer the next appointment and does her thing anyway. Disappointing.  	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Humana
70	1	Dr. Beiting's office is very professional and knowledgeable about dental care. What separates this dental practice from any of the others is their level of customer service and making sure their patients are more than satisfied with their experience. I would not trust my dental needs to anyone else in the Greater Cincinnati Area.  	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Humana
70	1	Going to the dentist is something most of us don't look forward to...Dr. Beiting has changed that fear for me !!!  She is an incredible dentist with the 'bedside manner' of an Angel.  She listens first and then explains everything she is doing...BEFORE and THROUGHOUT your procedure.  I have had cleanings, fillings and a crown procedure by Dr. Beiting.  She is the BEST dentist I have ever been to.  Loved my whiter teeth after ZOOM also !!! If you're looking for a dentist ~ you will be in great hands with Dr. Katherine Beiting. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
70	-1	I've been a patient of Beiting for a few years. I was happy with her UNTIL her last work. She did fillings on my front teeth, and top white layer of the filling detached the next day, leaving yellow filling visible underneath. Now, if I want that fixed, new filling has to be done, meaning drilling the tooth even more which I'm not happy about. Also, she removed the corner of my tooth without me requesting it, which I absolutely dislike as it made my tooth crack &amp; smaller. There's more to the story, but I'll leave it at that. Also, she charges more than other dental offices for the same procedures. I will not go back to her after the last incident. 	3	4	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
70	1	Dr. Beiting and her staff are absolutely wonderful. I've been with Beiting Family dentistry for over 20 years, back with Dr. Daniel Beiting was the primary dentist, now that he's retired, his daughter-in-law runs the practice.  From the receptionists (who have been there as far back as I can remember going there), to the dental hygenists, to Dr. Beiting herself, everyone goes out of their way to make sure you are comfortable (massage chairs to help you relax and darkened safety goggles to block any stray water droplets and bright dental lights) and at ease. The office is very high tech, x-rays and scans are uploaded to computers and are visable to patients just moments after being captured. The staff makes sure you are aware of what's going on with your teeth and explains it in an easy to understand manner. Between the technological advancements and the amazing care, you won't find a better dentist! 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown

My arm was swollen, had red streaks going up it and my thumb and hand were huge. I called in sick at work and saw my previous dr. who prescribed antibotics due to infection. When I went back for follow up with them, this dr.  refused to see me for going somewhere else! Is this America&#63;  I will go where they care! 	4	5	1	1 	Insurance:Humana

No resolution was given to negative lab results. 		3	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
83	0	I had a problem with some billing and talked to his staff and they were unconcerned, so, I had to talk with him.  He had to correct it himself.  I had some expensive dental work done and continued to have problems, and went back to him about these problems.  With following his instructions, problems continued.  I ended up losing two teeth, which should not have happened.  One problem continued.  I went to another dentist, who was very highly recommended and had to have surgery because one procedure was not done correctly.  I don't know anyone who would want to experience such poor dental work.  I have good dental insurance and pay my copay, so, payment was no factor in receiving poor dental work. 	3	3	4	1 	Insurance:Unknown

92	-1	I have been a patient for almost a year here and only have ever seen the nurse practitioner, Bridgett who is great. I have been called before to come in for pill counts 911 no problem, but this time, I had a bad pain day and slept through the call and the message just said, &quot;Please call us at ###-####&quot;. So I did when I woke up, but they were already closed. I called again the next morning first thing and they said I missed a pill count and that I had to do it within the 8 hours within the phone call. There are so many reasons why you could miss that call!! Anyway, A few days later, I got a letter in the mail stating that I had been kicked out of the program, don't call, don't come there, kiss their ass goodbye. Reason&#63; MISSED PILL COUNT/NO ANSWER. How stupid is that!&#63; Now I am so screwed because the one little pill I was getting from them is going to be so much fun to try and get from a new doctor before I run out and go into withdrawal. All Dr. Baird wants is the cash payers. $550a pop 	 7/25/12	1	1	1	Insurance:Medicare
92	0	Dr Baird - often comes in after opening time of 8:00 am as well as staff. I had many 8:00am appts and was still waiting in the parking lot waiting past appt time for Dr and staff to show up. Dr charges excessive fees for completion of forms (i.e. $300 fee to fill out continuing disability form total 2 pg. document with approx 10 questions. On one occasion Dr completed form during my exam (15 min time) and billed me additional $200 to complete form. STAFF - Billing is a joke. Consistently apply payments incorrectly or fail to bill Insurance at all. Have been denied service on appt date because billing claimed acct past due, but I found out that insurance had paid in full negotiated amount, but Billing would not even return my calls. Totally inept billing and bookkeeping staff. Dr also performs expensive tests such as DNA testing in lieu of metabolic panels (less costly) to check metabolism of drugs. Appears this Dr is more concerned with money than patient well being.  	 7/15/12	1	3	2	Insurance:Aetna
92	-1	I too have had MAJOR difficulties with billing. They have charged me FULL price for over a year and gave me all kinds of excuses on why my ins would not pay. Then when I finally called the ins company, they said the office had not filed a claim in over a year! The office keeps giving new reasons why and they have now filed it wrong over and over again and have not paid me the money they owe me.  When I threatened to call an attorney, they discharged me as a patient and filed two MORE claims wrong! I HAVE called an attoney, WHAS11 and am reporting them to the Medical License Board!! 	 7/9/12	1	2	2	Insurance:Anthem
92	0	The office staff is horrible!  We had SEVERAL billing issues with them, but I always paid them promptly after reviewing bills.  Once, my husband went to his appointment and they requested he pay on a bill that we had not seen yet.  I refused and told them that I needed to review bills PRIOR to paying them.  The office staff member became exceedingly irrate and told me that it is mandatory that I pay them some money even if I had not yet been sent a bill.  I told them if they wouldn't oblige, then I was taking my business elsewhere.  A week later we got a note in the mail saying they were terminating my husband as a patient because I had an attitude!  This office was also consistently running late.  Once we got stuck in traffic and called to tell them we would be 10 minutes late.  Just because we were late, they made us wait 2.5 hours to be seen at close of business even thought they were 1 hour behind when we got there.  We also could never get returned calls in an emergency.  Horrible! 	1	1	2	3 	Insurance:Humana
92	-1	Stay away from this place. As long as you pay anything they say you owe, you're his best patient. If you question a bill that your insurance has already paid, you're gone without any meds to help you through the time it takes to find another doctor.  If you don't believe me, then I feel sorry for you, a rude awakening is not far off.  Please stay away him, he will hurt you , bad.  	1	1	1	2 	Insurance:Medicare

Please be careful because this man cares for NO patient, no matter how ill you are.

92	1	Dr. Baird is very kind and has helped me tremendously. He's always willing to go the extra mile and is genuinly concerned about you. That said, he is quirky and tough. He can sometimes seem a little nosy but he's means well and is just trying to get to know you. Be aware, however that if you fail a drug test or abuse the medications he gives he will drop you immediately and will be extreamly irate, he will view it as a betrayal of his trust. Give him chance, even if he seems rude or strange at first, everyone has a bad day and he is really a good doctor, and thats a rare find these days. 	5	5	5	5 	Insurance:Unknown
92	1	Doctor Baird is the only doctor I've ever had the pleasure of knowing as a patient. He doesn't tire of his patients or thier medical journey. He will continue to try new things &amp; new approaches till the both of you are satisfied. I would have never made it thru the last decade of my life without his care. He is very knowledgeable in the medical &amp; holistic approaches with a vast variety of illnesses. If anyone was to ask me I would have to say, greatest doctor I've ever had the pleasure to work with.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare
92	0	He suggested that I try pot to aid pain relief or a few drinks then dismissed me for failing a drug test when the level was less than 20ppm,or that was the excuse. He was giving me 240 oxycodone 10mg per month. He made a nasty comment as a joke about my personal life, confidential information,in front of staff and office patients twice. In a time of personal crisis,I was taking Cymbalta, and was suicidal, he dismissed me as a patient. After that he &quot;blackballed me with every pain doctor I tried to get an appointment to see. They were canceled before I even spoke to the doctors after hearing from him. I'm a disabled veteran with a chronic pain condition related to PTSD. I don't have an axe to grind as he was a very nice laid back man who helped me a lot but changed abruptly almost &quot;over night&quot;.  	1	2	2	4 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield
92	-1	I arrived as asked 30 min early and was not seen until 1 hour and a half past my appt time.  Got a 45 second exam for a new pt and he wanted to run blood work on me but insulted me by telling me I was complaining about the distance I drove to see him, when I was only telling him my circumstances, and that he has people drive 2-3hours just to see him. I made the appt for a consult but was drug screened before ever being seen and was not given any helpful information for my condition.

92	-1	Dr. Baird dropped me as his patient when I failed a urine test after having surgery and being in the hospital for almost a week. I was examined by him below the waist and he even saw my stitches in. I didnt know what all they had given me. He also had me on suboxone for a long time. It was in the newspaper this week that it is not to be used for pain. He also put me on concerta and asked me what dosage I wanted after giving me 4 different selections. I swear to god I am not exagerating anything! I can pass a polygraph with flying colors!!! I can't get my medical records for a month and am currently having withdrawel from coming off ambien,morphine,and ritalin all at once. His office manager is rude and crude and of no help. The good news is I have an appointment with a doctor this Monday to see how badly I have been missmanaged. Please be very cautious with this doctor. He also owes me money. I only found out about it when he thought I owed him money.  	1	3	1	1 	Insurance:Humana

Literally asked me what I needed (in the way of meds)at each visit as tho he were giving out candy. Accused me of being an addict, yet HE was the one prescribing the meds! Used a lab (Ameritox) who charged over $1000 per claim when he could have used Lab Corp or another more reasonable company that my insurance company would have paid for! Not to mention they are out-of-network for almost every insurance company. Wondered if he was in cahoots w/them! Lectured me for not calling to have my script refilled when he couldn't find it in my urine specimen, yet he has a note in his office NOT to call for drug refills.  I would NOT recomment him to anyone.  	1	2	1	2 	Insurance:Humana

92	1	At first, he rubbed me the wrong way (he didn't seem very welcoming); however, as the appointment went along, I really came to enjoy him as a person, and a doctor. He knew a lot about my condition, both from a conventional and alternative medical perspective. I have not yet followed his medical advice, as I just met with him this morning. However, our plan give me great hope, and it's one that I feel very comfortable following. Not once did he push any medication or modality on me that I did not want. Furthermore, he took a personal interest in how I was from an emotional standpoint as well, which was a breath of fresh air.  	5	5	4	5 	Insurance:Humana
92	-1	this is one of the weirdest, rudest people i have ever encountered. i think he is taking some of the many drugs he hands out like candy! he asked me too many questions re my sex life. he put me on pain meds stronger than morphine. he yelled at me and made me cry. he said i must have been sexually ****ed as a child or i would not have the pain issues i did. he thinks he is god. he is fat telling people how to be healthy&#63;&#63; he told me that if i was going to see any other drs. he could not treat me. he was going to charge me $6,300.00 to treat me for a disease i did not have. his patients are so drugged that they can't even park well in front of his office. one woman had me  pinned in my car because she was parked so crooked. stay away from this man. 	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
92	-1	First visit was  $150 or $200, then $100.I was given prescriptions for suboxone on 2 occasions.The second rx resulted in finding out Baird was not qualified to write it.  The 3rd visit, for something else resulted in him telling me I had so much valium in my system, on the previous visit, that there was no way I could have walked in.  Further, I never took a valium. I was discharged from his care for violation of contract. He did not want to return my $100 but did so. I guess to save himself from embarrassment 	4	4	1	1 	Insurance:Unknown
92	-1	terrible, rude...i left in tears. i know i am not the only one...i was in his office 5 times and three of those times i saw a patient leave in tears. when i said this is to far to drive just to get medicine, that i needed treatment he promptly replied i am not here to &quot;sell&quot; !WOW!!!what did he think i was there for&#63; he never did one treatment, not one test, not one xray! if you just want drugs then he is great, if you want treatment or a cure, well, you are S--- out of luck.  	2	5	1	1 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

92	1	Dr.Baird is wonderful because he knows there are other ways besides main-stream medicine that bring healing to the body. He doesn't believe in &quot;masking&quot; symptoms but finding what will heal. I appreciate his life long pursuit of knowledge to help others and his willingness to see it through. He also knows that mankind did not get into the conditions they are in over night and will not be healed over night. Some results happen quicker than others. He is prudent, diligent and appreciates patients that are as well. He is committed to your healing and will help if you let him. One other thing I will mention is that Dr.Baird also realizes that we have families to care for and that our health care costs must be reasonable.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Anthem
92	1	Dr Baird and his staff gave me my life back. After an automobile accident, I went to many doctors for four years and none could help.

I just wish I had found Dr Baird sooner.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:Aetna

I left his office feeling like I finally found a physician that knew what I was going through and actually listened, I did not feel rushed in any manner. I feel better physically and mentally after one visit with Dr. Baird than I have with any Dr. ( And the Dr's I have been to in the past were treating me accordingly by the book) I feel like the &quot;old me&quot; which is a good thing.  		5	5	5 	Insurance:United Healthcare

Made sure I was screened for cancer and polyps and made every attempt to rule out any other causes.  He talks to you in a caring way and doesn't act superior because he has a medical degree.

97	1	I was suffering with back pain for a few months and seeing my family M.D. who would not prescribe the needed dosage amounts of lortab to control my pain. Upon seeing Dr. Bean for my consult he wrote a prescription and scheduled my surgery date. His office sent detailed information prior to surgery including directions to hospital and directions for in the hospital. Surgery was scheduled for 9:00 a.m., began at 10:10 a.m., lasted 45min., and I was on my way home 2hrs. later. 14 months prior I had prostate surgery and was nervous about my past experience with anesthesia due to being reintubated and staying longer. Dr. Bean and his staff were sensitive to my fears and assured me that they would be on top of it. They were.I was awake within minutes after surgery. I am now 9 days post op and I only regret not pursuing this surgery sooner. My brother and neice also have had success stories with Dr. Bean. Staff and Central Baptist get a 5 star rating from me.  	5	4	5	5 	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

Not what you would expect of someone of his caliber. Office staff not as friendly as they could be- they could all use sensitivity training. As long as your business there does not involve pain medication- you will be treated better. Otherwise you are just an addict and not worthy of respect or consideration.  	3	4	3	5 	Insurance:Anthem
