5	-1	 I ended up going to another doctor who could diagnose me properly.  The second doctor I saw knew right away what the problem was. Dr. Raj had no idea of where to start.  	2	3	2	1	Insurance:United Healthcare

18	-1	commentsVery unprofessional, rude, and argumentative. I've had some inconsiderate doctors, but I was shocked at how inconsiderate Dr. Ramey was. STAY AWAY!!! 	5	5	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
18	1	 Dr. Ramey is a good and caring doctor. I had been down the infertility road with another doctor in another state and knew what I wanted.  He listened to me and took my thoughts seriously, and pretty much let me decide the course of my own treatment, based on what I knew had worked in the past.  I was impressed by that - some doctors don't like the patients coming in with strong opinions about their care.  I appreciated him listening to me, and it worked on the first try - I am 19 weeks along with a healthy boy. :)  If we decide to go for one more pregnancy, I will be going back to him for sure.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

36	1	 Top-notch surgeon,very caring and compassionate.  I felt our infant son was in the best of hands with Dr. Raynor!  He took time to discuss the procedure in depth and answer all our questions.  Have had lots of other doctors comment on what a great job Dr. Raynor did with our son's surgery.  	4	5	5	5	Insurance:Humana
48	1	commentsI have been a patient for over 10 years and Dr. Rauscher is one of the very best dentists in the area. I have had regular cleanings, several crowns, and var other procedures and the results have been perfect -not just good -perfect. Dr. Rauscher has stayed late to accommodate my schedule. He has serviced emergencies for my wife on weekends if necessary. The crowns he created absolutely fit precisely. This is a small practice where you get individual attention and real care. 	4	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
48	-1	commentsDoctor and assistant argued in front of my son regarding a birthday party. Assistant left and doctor asked my son to hold the instruments. Doctor also insisted on starting tooth work when not area was not completely numb. The entire incident traumatized my 24 year old son! Please, don't put yourself through this and avoid this dentist! 		3	2	2	Insurance:Unknown

50	1	 Very diligent doctor.  Very thorough.  Very trustworthy (even though I am skeptical of many MD's).  He takes his time for the patient to understand the prognosis and allows the patient to ask many questions about a possible procedure.  	5	3	5	5	Insurance:Workers Comp

50	1	 Had rotator cuffs repaired in both shoulders last year; one in Jan and the other in December. The first took a little longer to heal than the second, but maybe because I knew what to expect. Re-checks were great. All staff were helpful, courteous, and responsive to calls and inquiries.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue Shield

70	1	commentsDr Rector Listen to you, wants to get to the problem at hand, wants to encurage you to live healthy life style. He dictates his findings onto a recording while you are there.

73	-1	commentsShe pushes anticunvulsants for pain which may help some but not all.  Why push anti seizure meds for pain or is it another way for doctors to say its in our head&#63;  Sh should be happy she hasn't been sued for causeing a seizure with prescribing these meds.  Avoid unless u know seizure meds work for you. 	3	2	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
