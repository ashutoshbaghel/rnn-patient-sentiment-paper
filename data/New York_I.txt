22	1	commentsDr. Icohea done a tummy tuck on me and i have to say i LOVE IT. the scare is exactly in the place he said it would be. i literally wore a string, yes a string bikini and you could not see my scar. I love him and dont want anyone else to touch me, his rates were very fare, professionalism was off the charts and his staff was awsome. after my surgery when i got home i called him and he called me back in 10 minutes. he took very good care of me and i love my surgery and would definately recommed him to anyone and i myself would go to him again. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
22	1	 Dr. Icochea is a very good doctor.  He explained everything to me in details and gave me a good price two years ago.  The result came out very good.  I do recommend this doctors.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:N/APaid/Co-pay:$4000
22	0	commentsNot a great experience. After paying all 14 k  for a tummy tuck, male breast reduction, and liposuction the results were terrible. the doctor sutured horribly. The line of the scar was more like a sad face on my abdomen and my belly button was horrible.  As far as procedure goes he's excellent but needs suturing perfection. afterwards he wanted to charge me 5000 to fix the horrible suturing. I decided to go to the Dominican Republic and got everything fix for 4,750 and the suturing is excellent!! had I known, I would have made that decision from the beginning. 	3	2	3	3	Insurance:Unknown

35	1	 Dr. Ickes is kind, compassionate and friendly, as well as an excellent listener and thinker. It's easy to talk with her and she gave me the time I needed to go over my health history and concerns, answering my questions in a detailed, understandable way.  She is willing to try holistic approaches first, if appropriate. I am impressed that her cell phone number is on her voicemail system for use by  patients during off hours. To me, that indicates her strong sense of responsibility to the patients in her practice and her belief in being available to them.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:MedicarePaid/Co-pay:N/A

I make sure my daughter goes twice a year, but myself I put it off for years, until we switched over to his dentistry. Now I will make sure I go twice a year, as well. I highly recommend Dr. Ibrahim. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
