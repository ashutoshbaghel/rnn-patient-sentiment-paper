1	-1	commentsTELLS HOSPITAL TO PUT ON LIST THAT HE'S TAKING NEW PATIENTS.  I CALLED AND GOT VOICEMAIL AND THEY CALLED BACK NEXT MORNING TO SET APPOINTMENT FOR THAT AFTERNOON. THEN THEY CALLED BACK 1/2 HOUR LATER TO CANCEL AND SAY I HAVE TO FILL OUT APPLICATION FIRST.  THEN THEY SCREEN APP TO SEE IF PATIENT HAS INSURANCE OR NOT.  EVIDENTLY IF YOU WANT TO PAY CASH HE WILL DENY YOU AS A PATIENT.  STAFF VERY INEFFICIENT AND DOES NOT RETURN CALLS TO UPDATE PROGRESS AS PROMISED. I HAD TO KEEP CALLING BACK.  WASTED A WHOLE DAY TRYING TO GET A APPOINTMENT.  IDEEN HIMSELF IS VERY RUDE AND HAS NO CONSIDERATION FOR SOMEONE IN NEED OF CARE.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO TREAT MY PETS. 	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
1	1	 I enjoyed Dr Ideen he was very helpful, in figuring out what was going on with me.  He also has helped tremendously with my daughters heart and lung problems.  	5	3	5	5	Insurance:CIGNA
1	1	commentsDr Ideen takes the time to explain conditions to his patients so they can understand them. HE IS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE!!! He is the ONLY doctor in Casper that continues to care for his patients while in the hospital. He is very personable and shows true compassion for his patients. His staff is very friendly. You can call almost anytime and get SAME DAY APPOINTMENTS if needed. I would strongly recommend him to everyone! Thank you Dr. Ideen for caring for my family. 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
1	-1	commentsA year ago I went to Ideen and Mcguire. They did not help me at all. I now have an excellent Dr. and have had to have a gall bladder operation, a hernia operation, and a double bowel blockage fixed. These are not pro's. All they could talk about was my wine and to quit drinking it! What a diagnosis..now I am on my way to a normal life.Thanks for nothing. 	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown

1	-1	 Misdiagnosed our father and kept him on the wrong medication for 6 years. Our father is suffering terribly due to his incorrect diagnosis. We feel Dr. Ideen was negligent in his practice.  		3	1	1	Insurance:Medicare
