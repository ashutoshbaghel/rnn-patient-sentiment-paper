16	1	 He's the best doctor I've ever had. He's wonderful. When I think of doctors that seem to truly have a calling to the profession, he's the one that pops in my mind. I can't speak any more highly of him.  		5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

20	1	 Very helpful/friendly staff. Never have had a long wait and sometimes called before scheduled appointment. Dr. is very knowledge, helpful and kind.   He was located at a different location and we followed him to his knew location, which is a very beautiful clean office 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
25	0	 Nice Doctor with a pleasant demeanor. However old and not very good at diagnosing. The nurses joke about him, they don’t divulge privileged information but he is clearly not respected.  My experience is he makes guesses and assumes he is correct without taking time for tests and doesn’t  like when a second opinion is asked for. Some of the locals will not deal with him because of being to “old school.” All in all pleasant but not a very good doctor. He is at a point where he should just retire.  	5	5	2	3	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
37	1	 Dr. Halbur is an awesome doctor!  King, caring, and knowledgable.  He spends whatever time YOU need to get to the bottom of whatever your medical issue is.  I ahve been a patient for the past 14 years and think he is first class.  you cannot go wrong trusting Dr. Halbur with your medical needs.  If he thinks you need a specialist, he will not hesitate to tell you.  Another sign of a great doctor.  His bedside manner is second to none.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

66	-1	commentsThis doctor is beyond rude. She does not care about what you have to say. Her attitude is the worst i've ever encountered.Does not even acknowledge you as a patient and cuts you off as you are speaking. Frowns constantly as if you came in to bother her. Not recommended!!! 	4	1	1	1	Insurance:Unknown
66	-1	 Would never go to her again.  She is very rude, rough  and unfriendly. She treated me like an animal, not a person. I went home a cried after my appointment.  Get out of medicine, if you do not like working with people.  	3	2	1	3	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
