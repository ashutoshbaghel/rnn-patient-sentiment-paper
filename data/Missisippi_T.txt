8	-1	commentsDr terry is not a people person. He doesnt care about how you feel. He just hops in and out of the room unconcerned. Not nice at all. He needs togo back to school to learn how to treat people. 	2	2	2	2	Insurance:Unknown
8	-1	 I was treated very bad at his office, from the rep. to him. Im guessing it was because i was oon workers comp. they underhanded and went behind my attorney's back and communicated with workers comp. I'm going to sue the pants and take the Dr. from Dr. terry.. When you swim with the sharks you will get eaten ha.Im taking this all the way to cnn and msnbc. For some reason these businesses in Mississippi think they can get away with a lot of things sorry the bus stops here...  	1	1	1	1	Insurance:Workers Comp

64	-1	 Not proffesional at all. I had my pospartum visit, and was supposed to have done my pospartum exam, he just asked me a couple questions and then want to leave the office without making the exam, when I told him that he was supposed to be cheked then he asked me if I want the post partum exam, I felt embarased and did not felt the confidence to say yes.  He was not supposed to ask me if I want this exam done, this is part of the pospartum visit and all womans are supposed to have this exam done 6 to 8 after giving birth. Then they gave me the reciept for that visit and It said that he did the exam when he never did, so my inssurance was about to pay for something that he never did, It also said the he explain me about loosing weight counseling when he never talk to me about that.  I was so dissapointed at this point ant did not want to talk to him so I talk to another doctor from the same office (dr firouzback, she is exelent) I explain her the situation and she did the exam.  	2	5	1	3	Insurance:Tricare

93	1	commentsDr. Talton did surgery on a carotid artery of mine years ago and used a patch on it. The carotid artery was very small in size. I am facing surgery on the same artery now &amp; he refuses to do it. I called and asked why he wouldn't do the surgery and was told that he wasn't qualified to insert a stent. 	5	5	4	4	Insurance:Unknown
94	1	commentsDr. Earl Taylor is one of the top Chiropractors in the southern region of the United States. He currently treats patients from Texas to Florida. With a steady, thriving practice of patients from MS, AL, AK, TN and La, its apparent he is very knowledgeable about musculoskeletal conditions! He stays current on the latest chiropractic techniques and and modalities that are pertinent to treating the vast majority of conditions seen in today's population! Without any reservations, I highly recommend Dr. Taylor and the staff of Dorsey/Taylor Chiropractic, Nutrition &amp; Rehab! 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
