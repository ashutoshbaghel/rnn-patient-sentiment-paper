16	1	 I have been seeing Dr Lamp for many years and would highly recommend him for all your optical needs.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
16	1	 He is the best doctor ever.  Found cancer in my grandfather when no one else could.  Gave me a few more great years with him.  Then I switched doctors and he found a prism problem that others called a stigmatism.  I now drive from KC to see him and send everyone to Dr. Lamp.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

22	1	 Wow......I felt like I had just spent time with a family friend then a doctor. She spent 25 minutes with me talking about weight loss options and was not only knowledgable but sloop kind. I have never laughed, cried with and hugged a doctor in the same visit....go see her..... you will love her too 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:MedicarePaid/Co-pay:N/A

23	1	commentsDR LANGAKER WAS SINCERELY ATTENTIVE AND CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY HEALTH.SHE SUGGESTED AN OSTEOPOROSIS SCAN WHICH I DID WHILE THERE.  SHE WAS COVERING ALL THE BASES.  VERY GOOD1 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
23	1	 Dr. Langaker is a wonderful doctor for well-woman exams. She would be great for younger women who are nervous about going to the gyno. She's gentle, thorough and very grounded. I haven't gone to her for anything other than an annual exam, so I can't comment on her deliveries. Her only negative is that she does tend to get behind compared to the other doctors in the practice, so the wait times can be a little long, but she makes up for it with her attention and care.  	5	4	5	5	Insurance:CoventryPaid/Co-pay:N/A
25	1	 I really like Dr. Lang. I will be keeping him as my medical dr. as long as I can. His office is very nice and his bedside manner is nice as well. He doesn't do quick fixes, but usually expects follow ups within 2 weeks. He's amazing.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:CoventryPaid/Co-pay:N/A

30	-1	commentsAt first he was helpful.  Something really changed. I gave it several more tries and it just got worse and worse.  The communication about goals didn't match the treatments, and outcomes went in the wrong direction.  There was a flip. 	2	5	2	2	Insurance:Unknown

41	1	 Very nice and experienced doctor: We are very blessed to have a great doctor provide care for our Dad who had significant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. He was turned down by several EPs in town. Dr. Lakkireddy took up the challenge and fixed him. We are ever indebted to him.  JS 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A

41	1	commentsI had ventricular tachycardia for most of adult life since 1994. I have been on different types of medications and two attempted ablations. Finally, by mere providence I found this doctor who worked on me and my problem fixed. I can never repay this doctor who gave me my life back. KS, Kansas City, MO 	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Unknown

52	1	commentsDr. Lancaster was recommended to me by my regular physician. The first visit went well. After I was approved for surgery he threatened to not do my surgery if I didn't lose enough weight in time. He also told me I had to work out an hour a day every day for the rest of my life. At the hospital I was very anxious. He came in and the first thing he asked me was how much weight did I lose&#63; I told him I lost 18 pounds in three weeks, and all he said was, thats it&#63; I thought he was kidding so I smiled and said are you serious&#63; He didn't say anything and walked away. That made me more anxious right before I was operated on. The next day in the hospital he came into my room to check on me and asked if I had gotten up and walked. I told him I had twice since the surgery and he said that's it&#63; Again! He said I need to get up and move! In a very rude manner. I told him I was waiting on the nurse to help me get up and he said I need to go now! Then he left. He makes me feel lazy and worthless. I really hate him! 	4	2	4	5	Insurance:Unknown
52	-1	 Doctor Brent A. Lancaster M.D. was 3 hours late for my Colonoscopy. He did not treat me with dignity, he was not considerate, he neglected to inform me of the result's of my surgery, when I asked him in person, he refused to speak with me. I do not suggest anyone to use this doctor.  	4	1	1	1	Insurance:AetnaPaid/Co-pay:N/A

67	1	commentsThe medical doctors told me I was dying, hey, I'm still here to rate Dr. L'Hommedieu, so he must of done ALLOT right.  He's a Christian, has a wonderful manner, and is VERY knowledgeable about his field of study.  I would HIGHLY recomment Dr. L'Hommedieu to anyone seeking help.  Go for it, when you think your at the bottom, start looking up, and look up Dr. L'Hommedieu and give him a call.  I had neck, back and Liver issues. 	5	4	5	5	Insurance:Unknown
71	1	 He treated our son like he was one of their own.  We couldnâ€™t have been more pleased with the care he provided us.  His energy and genuine demeanor made a difficult and stressful time much easier.  	5	5	5	5	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
74	1	 I as well as other members of my family have gone to Dr Labes numerous times for various reasons.  He is always quite pleasant and never makes you feel like &quot;just a number&quot;.   A great doctor! 	4	4	5	4	Insurance:Blue Cross / Blue ShieldPaid/Co-pay:N/A
